You might as well pocket that money and use it towards getting furnished apartment - which for a 2 bedroom is about QR8;000 - If you are only earning QR13;500; your salary diminishes drastically and you are only left with QR5;500 for a Car; monthly utilities; groceries; school fees and entertainment.... and if you are only getting QR1000 for your airticket home; then you are going to need to save for the rest of your ticket and that of your wife and child.

352,Q321,Am i going to be penalize by mistakenly jumping the red light but reverse back when realized it was not yet green?,Q321_R21_C3,Good,From my personal experience - The Camera will only flash once you Jump the Red Light which means over the zebra crossing. If you happen to cross the zebra crossing in flashing Green or Yellow you will be lucky enough not to get the picture taken. My sister jumped a Clear Red signal at 38 kms per hr speed and she had to 6000QRS and 7 points on the Drivers license. The traffic dept will have a clear video and recording of the incident which you can verfy with. I hope this does not happen to you. Just in case do check this website on timely basis to know of any violations. http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/ Good Luck
353,Q321,Am i going to be penalize by mistakenly jumping the red light but reverse back when realized it was not yet green?,Q321_R21_C4,Good,Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ... So; If you've crossed the lights while anything but red; you are good. Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink (that is just a personal choice) because the fines are just too hefty. But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly. You can pass through even on amber; but it is just not worth taking that risk. Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights.

366,Q321,Am i going to be penalize by mistakenly jumping the red light but reverse back when realized it was not yet green?,Q321_R23_C7,Good,But he did go over the line; thats why he was flashed. To the OP; dont believe all these people that tell you 'It happened to me'; or 'I know a guy who this happened to'. They are talking rubbish. Just check online using the link I posted and see if you have a fine. If you do; appeal. If you dont have a fine; happy days.
367,Q321,Am i going to be penalize by mistakenly jumping the red light but reverse back when realized it was not yet green?,Q321_R23_C8,Good,Don't generalize your own habits to everybody in here. plus if you don't have any idea about a subject just stay quiet. camera flashes when you pass over the sensors which are installed just on pedestrian walkway in front of you. its not necessary to cross the whole signal to get flashed. my case was exactly the same; happened in small signal near apollo polyclinic. i went over the pedestrian walkway by the same mistake and then returned. i believe he didn't cross the signal coz the opposite side traffic was flowing. camera takes two snapshots plus a short video. even if they fine; he can appeal and video is his proof.

462,Q322,"""""Can any body advice where to get gold loan in Qatar?""",Q322_R32_C3,Good,Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....

484,Q322,"""""Can any body advice where to get gold loan in Qatar?""",Q322_R48_C5,Good,It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.
485,Q322,"""""Can any body advice where to get gold loan in Qatar?""",Q322_R48_C6,Good,"""I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris.

What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done.

534,Q323,first job ever?,Q323_R7_C5,Bad,The players decide who goes first; perhaps via ip dip; (American: Eeny; meeny; miny; moe) or a variant; then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area. The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface; then pick up jacks; then catch the ball before it bounces twice. There are variants on this procedure. Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced. Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target; if that is in the vicinity of play. Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all. In some variants; the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn. Perhaps more commonly; the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (onesies); next two (twosies); and so on. In most versions of the game; only one hand may be used. To simplify play; both may be used; to make it harder; or to impose a handicap; a player might be required to use their off-hand (eg; the left if right-handed). http://en.wikipedia......

You just have to pay it when your road permit is up or if you're involved in a car accident; they check for violations then.

I tried to post earlier but I was disconnected and it seems that my post is not here. Man you can pay at any time but before renewing your car registration. When you go for that they will ask you to clear all the violations that you got. First time I hear about the 10% thing; might be a new thing but never hear of it. The guys are right as well as the Airport one is less crowded than the Khalifa branch. You can also pay for that in 'Giant Stores' or 'Villagio' as I remember. I saw an office there for the Traffic Department. There is also in 'Hammad Hospital' down there near the Parking area down there. It is empty all the time. Good Luck

If this is to be bought as a long-term investment (over ten years); do you believe there will be sustained growth beyond the current property bubble? 2. What are the threats that exist to current property values in Doha? Can you foresee any international conflicts in the next two years that could wipe out the current property boom? 3. What will be the effect in the medium term (five to ten years) of continued property development on prices? 4. Are there reliable data on how the expatriate population will grow over the next five to ten years? Do you know whether there will be a growth in single people versus families; or vice versa. How will this affect demand for flats versus villas? 5. Is the current property boom caused by real demand; or by an increase in liquidity in Qatar because of high crude prices? 6. What is the proposed lifespan for the development? Is this lifespan supported by structural engineers reports? 7. If buying a property before completion; is it likely that it w.....
632,Q324,My husband and I are looking for a flat/apartment or villa to sublet or that we can pay cash for monthly. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!,Q324_R21_C3,Good,Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider. I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point; the Pearl; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply. But on the other hand; Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s. The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment. As far as Lusail goes - I've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time. The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July. They still have a couple of apartments left near the top I hear so it might be a better investment than Lusail given delays etc.....
633,Q324,My husband and I are looking for a flat/apartment or villa to sublet or that we can pay cash for monthly. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!,Q324_R21_C4,Good,You should not compare it to Dubai since prices in dubai when they statred selling 5 years ago were low and there was a big potential for buying; in Doha; a 2 bed appartment is selling for the same price as in dubai now; so even though there will be some upward potential; i dont think its enough to take the risk second; when i first came here in january i was interested in buying and i went to see the buildings with al sabban towers and they said that out of three towers they still have one to be sold; 6 months later they still had few appartment in that same tower; and now they are also selling the other two which were still not sold; in dubai; a compound of 6000 villa was sold in three days. third; between the pearl and lusail and waab cilty finishing all together; i dont think that doha is ready to fill all these empty appartments with such an inflation and people are starting to lok for other alternatives than doha I always tell the truth; even when I lie
634,Q324,My husband and I are looking for a flat/apartment or villa to sublet or that we can pay cash for monthly. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!,Q324_R21_C5,Good,I have brought on the zig Zag about 7 months ago; and it has gone up so say 300;000 ryals. Not bad I hear you say but its paper money till you sell it; and I don't yet see an emerging sales market. Personally I am torn now; sell when the towers are finished take a quick profit OR Rent and hold on to it long term. Right now I am looking at the former; if i can make even 200;000 I am happy as that is more than the bank would have given me. We shall see; I would recommend zig zag purely because it will be finished first; the Pearl looks good long term and will be desirable. If al Wabb is cheap then great; get in. Loisil well that really is a lonnnnng way off; at least 5 years in my opinion before it would be worth it. but as a long term bet it could be good and might actually be a better bet than the Pearl as I think that NOW its over priced. Some friends got in when prices were lower; but now is is crazy money and there will be A LOT of towers down there.

Thank you!,Q324_R21_C7,Bad,"""Dear aviduser; actually the same question as already posted by navi ...""""what is the situation for residence permit?"""" are you getting it straight after the purchasing property or need to wait until it's completion; or even something else. How is the law and rules work here? You advise will be very valid for me; since I'm too new for this place. Congrats; for your purchase but now I'm totally confused whether it's worthy to look for Lusail or not? All these buildings won't be finished before 2010;so no return from any of the investment upon that time; which makes bank loan too heavy for me. Any approximate expectation on rental prices for ZigZag? What is the actual prices now for apartments in these towers since you already planning to sell them soon? Thanks."""

But it means that you don't need exit permits any more. Then if you quit your job you can stay move job do whatever. This all sounds great I know but I am thinking that if you tell an employer you don't need to be sponsored they may not hire you as they have less control over you. In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus. Zig Zag two beds are up now for about 1.9 million they were 1.6 Rental returns well I don't know; compared to Beverly Hills tower where the average is 18K I am hoping for 14-16K Hopefully. Loisil is so long away the financing in this country does not make any sense. Dubai was mentioned earlier; what people fail to mention with that """"boom"""" is flats were offered with very low down payments and then nothing until completion.

Thank you!,Q324_R35_C1,Good,Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers...

Thank you!,Q324_R35_C2,Good,I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.
642,Q324,My husband and I are looking for a flat/apartment or villa to sublet or that we can pay cash for monthly. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!,Q324_R35_C3,Good,Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....

644,Q324,My husband and I are looking for a flat/apartment or villa to sublet or that we can pay cash for monthly. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!,Q324_R35_C5,Good,Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.

Thank you!,Q324_R35_C7,PotentiallyUseful,I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?

Thank you!,Q324_R38_C8,PotentiallyUseful,don't believe the stupid people who say it's ok to not pay the loan. the insurance does not cover termination. when you applied for a loan; there normally is a clause in your salary letter (depending on where you're employed) saying that it is your employer's responsibility to inform the bank that you are leaving their services and/or your final dues will be paid to your bank account with them. you may need a clearance letter from the bank before you are able to leave qatar permanently. you may be able to get away with a simple exit permit but you might become blacklisted and might never be given a visa to enter qatar or even the gcc again. also; they might have ways to find and go after you; you never know.

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.

If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.

No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year.

You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month; but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years; and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car.

One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....

The feedback is very positive. Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.

I currently work for Education here in the UK - it appears your approach to Qatar is much the same as mine - giving up the housework etc... and as for getting trim again I am also going to enrol in some slow toning classes! Did you find it easy to make friends in Doha. My husband has been there a week and could not even get to the beach on Friday as it was members only. Any suggestions for a place he can relax on his day off? He is waiting for us to get there to join clubs etc... Appreciate your help.

Timings also please!! :),Q327_R62_C5,Bad,My husband came over by himself and he found the first week awful. He nearly came home several times. If your husband likes a drink he could try Garveys or the Rugby club. Alot of british use these. I believe you have to join as a member or come with someone as a guest. Tell him to buy a copy of the Marhaba in Carrefours supermarket in City Centre. that lists all events happening in Q and where to go. It is updated every season. It is also available at Jarirs bookstore. What co. does your husband work for?

Timings also please!! :),Q327_R62_C6,Bad,I have emailed you directly as I am sure there is more knowledge you can share with me. Do you live in a villa or apartment. Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old; he is used to playing out on his bike etc... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....

Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.

Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.
1131,Q329,Today technology is growing faster but have you ever thought the other side of the technology whether how it can effect in our life ?,Q329_R44_C2,PotentiallyUseful,Haven't tried Mothercare at CC. I hate going there but I may have to... M&S does not have a Maternity section. I don't get this... every local has at least 5 kids; plus every expat seems to be pregnant. Where do they all shop for clothes?
1132,Q329,Today technology is growing faster but have you ever thought the other side of the technology whether how it can effect in our life ?,Q329_R44_C3,Good,I tried H&M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

1134,Q329,Today technology is growing faster but have you ever thought the other side of the technology whether how it can effect in our life ?,Q329_R44_C5,Good,hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.
1135,Q329,Today technology is growing faster but have you ever thought the other side of the technology whether how it can effect in our life ?,Q329_R44_C6,Good,Based on all our comments; a trip to City centre is on the cards :-).

Not only in Qatar but in all the GCC. Now they are THINKING of Railway networks....as if it is some kind of new technology!"""
1197,Q329,Today technology is growing faster but have you ever thought the other side of the technology whether how it can effect in our life ?,Q329_R75_C8,Good,I don't think the problem is with HMC as far utilising the medical city building is concerned; but i don't know the details. Similarly; housing allowance is provided to everybody who is eligible or who's contract states housing allowance. One problem facing HMC is that it had hired lot of staff in 2 years; mostly females; all of them now want to bring in their families and get a house from HMC. This ain't easy.
1198,Q329,Today technology is growing faster but have you ever thought the other side of the technology whether how it can effect in our life ?,Q329_R75_C9,PotentiallyUseful,superdoc ...housing Does such a big organisation that plans to increase manifold have its own Housing Quaters (other than Rented flats)......???? How can they plan a Big organisation without building its own housing Quaters? If HMC doesnt expect staff to bring in their famlies they should state it in the Contract.
1199,Q329,Today technology is growing faster but have you ever thought the other side of the technology whether how it can effect in our life ?,Q329_R75_C10,Good,Jackmphan They are know thinking about including the single status in the contract. I am just putting everything into picture; HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years. When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance. Almost all took housing allowance; then they called their families on visit visa; once their husbands found a job in qatar; they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC. This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent. By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs; i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families. Plus not so long ago; no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females; they either get single accomodation or nothing at all.

I have been offered QT23k all in package is this okay. no kids but spouse. is this a good deal?""",Q333_R34_C5,Good,I bought a grand vitara last year XL7 it was for a good price. but i really regretted; the service of teyseer is the worst I've ever experienced: lousy; unhelpful service staff with disgusting facilities. I took me two visits to the service center before i give up and started taking it to other oil changing shops . besides; the car has many manufacturing defects (according to a friend he is still facing them in his new model): CD player; brake system... At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price (67000); but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder. On the top of all that the resale value of the suzuki is not so encouraging.

As a general rule most UK brands (such as BHS; Next; M&S; H&M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to £1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to £1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession. If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.

There are now MANY landlords who are refusing to pay any commission to agents; and this has therefore led almost EVERY main agency in Qatar to start charging tenants.

The UAE has a regulatory body in place....but tenants pay 5% there in fees for EVERY deal! Often the service is terrible there; even with the laws in place. As has been said; it's a one off payment.

Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to; in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation.

Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.

It was there that I discovered that I had sleep apoenea; and they have treated that now. Its abslutely amazing to sleep all night every night; {except when I forget and have caffeine; or a fizzy drink by mistake) - first time in over 40 years! Go to the second floor (the one above ground floor)in the OutPatient Dept and ask at room 215 for the sleep clinic. They will direct you as to what you have to do to be assessed. You will need a Hamad Health Card (100 QR) for this. Angelwings.

Many thanks""",Q336_R37_C3,Bad,I had to stay overnight at the Hamad Hosp; while a couple monitored me all night from another room. I was wired up all over the place; which for me wasn't too comfortable; and then left to 'sleep'... which I did very little of anyway as I didn't like the 'wiring'. I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon; who checked the size of my jaw; tongue etc etc; and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea. I didn't do the 'sleeping pills run' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue (sounds gross; but wasn't really that bad). But this is definitely the route to take; as pills may not be the answer for you... maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected.

It takes 6 hours to flush out caffeine from the body; which is found in not only the obvious; like tea and coffee; but also in fizzy drinks like coke; seven-up etc; tonic water (very; very bad!!); soda water; beer; and sparkling wines and sparkling mineral water. Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep. Also; chocolate is a sleep depriver too. If you're taking any of the above within six hours of going to bed; then you'll have sleep problems if you react to them. Most folk don't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa; late on in the day; but that's saying goodbye to sleep! regardless of what stress you are or aren't under. I stayed awake for four days once; when I was drinking just tonic water (I don't have a sweet tooth). A friend told me of his similar situation when he'd had a tonic water in a 'mixer' drink.

It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling.

But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask.

Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! .

Full course may be required if you don't have existing license or expired. Otherwise; no driving school will require a full course. There are a lot of driving schools out there; Al rayya driving school; karwa; etc.

2264,Q340,Today My freind behaive very strange.he pic a child suit and run away from city centre shop without paying money.now he is very upset he is on visit visa.is there any security systems in shops? if they catch him what happen? many shops have cameras system can they arrest it on Airport when he is going back to home?,Q340_R63_C5,Bad,Notice rodqie76; he mention that they forcibly or tactfully impose long/full course through so called pre test;and they refuse students to go for the test with traffic department; and after giving admission fee no one think to go any other institute. Why don't they allow direct test with traffic dept;Let them decide who can drive or not.don't pressurize for long course!! Make each and every thing clear at the time of admission. Anyone can help or suggest how to stop out from such situation????
2265,Q340,Today My freind behaive very strange.he pic a child suit and run away from city centre shop without paying money.now he is very upset he is on visit visa.is there any security systems in shops? if they catch him what happen? many shops have cameras system can they arrest it on Airport when he is going back to home?,Q340_R63_C6,Good,So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule. Point is if traffic department allows for short course or direct test why they take pre-test and enforce for full course. It is good only for those who are not sure either they can drive properly or not!!!not for all......... any way Congratulations you got your licence after having full course.

I think it was because we did not have a male escort they were very being very difficult. It was not a hotel I would normally chosen to have stayed in; but there was a big conference on and I had to resort to this one. Turns out even my marriage certificate was not good enough as we got a knock on the door at 11.00pm and told to leave the hotel .. they said I did not have a ministry stamp on my marriage certificate; nor did I have a LETTER OF PERMISSION from my husband. I was so angry .... I got the man to ring my husband; but that wasn't good enough either .. this was when they said I needed the ministry's stamp on my marriage certificate!!!!!! Anyhows; my husband and I have regularly stayed in hotels in Doha. If you are going to stay in one of the 4 or 5 star ones they generally just ask you to produce your passports. I don't think they will let you book the one room knowing you are not married. If I was you; I would book in under your.....

We know a couple of Al Jazeera Int'l employees and they were given really great spacious furnished apartments (I think they were 3bdrm).

2356,Q341,What did che guevara do to get so famous?? we see his pic on t shirsts...,Q341_R32_C7,Bad,Hi Che and others; I'm also coming to Doha to work for Al Jazeera Insha Allah. Apart from waiting over 2 months now for my flight intinary since signing the contract (!) I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best
2357,Q341,What did che guevara do to get so famous?? we see his pic on t shirsts...,Q341_R32_C8,Good,aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.

Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration. Better have your medical check up there before coming here. Like chest x-ray and blood stool urine lab test. If you fail here you will be sent back.

The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines. They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration; they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully? I hate to say this but ; my tax when I was still working in Manila;paid them well enough... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money! :D Just my 2 cents here!

There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle; as one criminal group.

Certain laws and regulations change; and it can be a frustrating place; but on the whole you can live a very nice life here. I moved from London; and adjusted pretty easily. Come with an open mind and you'll be fine. There are plenty of people in the same position and you'll meet other expats easily. What I will say; is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you don't make the effort....especially for the wife. Hopefully she's outgoing; and it shouldn't be a problem to meet people. Choosing where to live is a big part! Maersk is in West Bay so possibly get an amazing apartment here close to all the bars and restaurants and City Center for shopping. Better for the wife if she can walk to places....Get somewhere short term in West Bay to start and give yourself a chance to learn about Doha and where you want to be permanently located.

The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck!

They came and packed my items at home. We left to UK and later we were shocked to know that this guy from Runway International demanding more money else he said he is not going to ship my consignment. I had no other alternative but to transfer money. He said my shipment will reach me in 45-60 days but in reality it reached us in 98 days. Once we received our items we were shocked to see that the boxes were tampered; opened and repacked. We realize that our items have been stolen. When we asked this guy from Runway International he said he is not responsible and asked us to claim through insurance. We spent almost 4 months in constant calls; emails and communications. Never got straight forward response from Runway International. I would recommend not to go with such companies and avoid them. I recommend to go with reputed freight and moving companies like DHL; ARAMEX; Agility; FedEx even if it costs .....

The silly (Lebanese) manager at the Mall shop said no discount; only for repeat customers! They wanted to maintain exclusivity.

Do not bring your furniture because most apartments around Doha are fully furnish.I notice the difference between fully & semi is only 2k Qatari Riyals. I made a mistake bring my own furniture as I was recommended to bring.But the shipment container was paid for so I don't mind. So now i just mix my one set furniture which consist of 3 seater; 2 seater & one seater;carpet & one table with the apartment's furniture. Furniture at home centre are not that expensive IMO. if you do find a apartment or villa semi furnished.

Thanks S""""""",Q347_R5_C2,Good,Hey fitri; We moved here Oct 2004 from Dallas and it took roughly 60 days for our furniture and household goods to arrive. I'm not sure about your second question. As far as I know the shipment made its way to us shortly after it arrived and had cleared customs; so we never stored it. I suppose it would have been nice to send it 2 months in advance of our arrival though.

Thanks S""""""",Q347_R5_C4,Good,I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz

The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.

If not he would definitely arrange one for you. Or if you could drive down to Alfardan bus stand; you can find such big pickups parked in line with pathans sitting in the driving seats. The rate will obviously depend on from where you have to pickup your furniture and where to drop; but it should be within or around QR100. Bargaining will possibly bring down what you end up paying.

3046,Q348,Any Aquapark in Doha?,Q348_R34_C7,Bad,Mrs QL...whats a dirty look??
3047,Q348,Any Aquapark in Doha?,Q348_R34_C8,Bad,I know what you are saying about dirty looks and I too am always in jeans and t-shirts. I get embarressed though when I see women in revealing or too tight tops... I want to confront them they are the reason we get such a bad name here... But I agree; an Aqua Park is for swimwear; what are swimming costumes for then?
3048,Q348,Any Aquapark in Doha?,Q348_R34_C9,Bad,Tinker; as you said; it does not matter what you wear; there are always some who feel they have the right to judge. I don't care anymore...as a matter of fact; my friends commented on how I do not even notice attention; good or bad; anymore.I am totally oblivious to it. Hold your head high and enjoy what you are doing. The waterpark; as I said; none of my concern; as I will not go there; at all. For many reasons.
3049,Q348,Any Aquapark in Doha?,Q348_R34_C10,Bad,I dont really mind the dress code. I guess it will be hard for me not to stand out anyway. I do wish there was some kind of meduim when it comes to swim wear. Maybe there is. I guess I will have to find out. I'm sure there is something acceptable out there. :)

3082,Q348,Any Aquapark in Doha?,Q348_R76_C3,PotentiallyUseful,Yes Maji08; because I am also under husband's sponsorship; for a prospective job offer from semi-government; I went through the same proess.

3084,Q348,Any Aquapark in Doha?,Q348_R76_C5,Good,Dear Maji08; They did not ask you because being a resident of Qatar; you must have already done your finger print for your RP; which is saved in their comuter records. When you apply for CID clearance for a job offer; they will check on the computer your finger prints; which they will use it to process your certificate. This was done in my case both in medical and CID clearance obtained for a job offer. Hope it is clear now.

First of all they were supposed to do a hotel booking on my return ticket which wasnt even confirmed till the time i was at the airport waiting for someone to pick me up from the hotel. Secondly the hotel that they did put us up in was in some freaking god forsaken sh*t hole in Mumbai; that even the taxi drivers didnt know where it was. I mean the staff at the QA are totally useless since they fill them with all inexperienced FEMALES just coz of their good looks.

Back home we leave 15 -20 percent.""",Q351_R1_C1,Good,Those people dont earn much salary and ofcourse they are expecting you to give something for they side money( for lunch; transportation; etc) Give at least 10% of the price of what you eat..or give reasonable amount..and even better if you give it from your heart without bitching. hehehe
3301,Q351,"""""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent.""",Q351_R1_C2,Good,Tipping does not appear to be customary among the local population. The people who perfom the tasks you have listed typically make between 600 and 1000 riyals per month; when that's the going rate for labor; one might surmise that Qatar is not home to a culture of conspicuous generosity. I suggest that you go with your conscience; bearing in mind that anything you give will probably be put to good use. With the exception of the car washers; none of these people have any control whatsoever over the prices of the services that they perform. What they can control is the service itself; and I generally use that as the basis for my own calculations.
3302,Q351,"""""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent.""",Q351_R1_C3,Good,For the car wash; since it's usually 8 QR; I tip 2 QR For restaurants; I check to see if the tip has already been included in the bill. If it hasn't and the service has been good; I tip about 15 - 20 % of the total. BTW; hotels and some restaurants usually add a surcharge that is NOT the tip so check your bill - you might think tip is included when it's really not. For the gas attendants; I normally give about 3 QR when I fill up the car (it costs me about 30 QR to fill up). For the tea boy; I'm assuming the company compensates the person adequately - I haven't been here long enough but I would leave a tip at Christmas and special holidays; something like 100 QR - this also goes for the security guys at my compound. If someone pushed my cart and loaded the groceries into the car; I'd tip about 5 QR (if someone has to push my cart; it means I must have a ton of groceries). I haven't tipped the person who bags the groceries since I'm unsure about this one. I don't know the salaries of th.....

I keep talking to office boys; cleaners and my houseboy quite often. Some of these are paid as low as Qrs. 450 per month. Infact; I know of our ex-office/tea boys; their company failed to renew the contract and they were jobless for couple of months. It isn't their responsibility to renew the contract obviously; but the sponsor penalised them by paying just Qrs. 100 per month until they could find another contract elsewhere! I think we are all lucky and should be thankful that we're paid really well when compared to these guys. I know few would argue that we are educated and we deserve to be where we are. But little generosity won't affect us much. 1. The guy that pushes the shopping trolley for you A: I PUSH MY OWN TROLLEY; IF SOMEONE DOES HELP ME I PAY QR. 2/- PER TROLLEY. 2. The person that washes your car A: MY HOUSEBOY WASHES MY WIFE'S CAR. WE PAY HIM A FIXED AMOUNT; BUT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS; WE PAY HIM QRS. 50 OR 100. 3. The tea boy.....

I tip the guys who pack my bags about ten qr once a week; tip the guys who put petrol in my car like 5 - 10 qr; never had anyone push a trolley for me thou - thats what my arms are for! tip in resturants too;thou not fast food outlets for some reason ( does anyone tip there ?) we should all tip those who can afford to; people earn very little out here and no matter who you think you are that could be you one day; so treat everyone as if you know them when you are dealing with them in these situations! And always say please and thank you too; you would be amazed how few do!
3306,Q351,"""""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent.""",Q351_R1_C7,Good,I usually judge of the quality of service recieved. Unlike many place except in Doha people don't tip as often as they should. Now probably back home when you got out and do the shopping someone bags your shopping with a smile (and not a grumble) walks you to your car with a smile (and not a grumble)then you tip them well. Personally... if they just to do it for the sake of getting a tip off an expat and you hand them over 2 riyals you'll still see tham standing there waiting for more?!

3316,Q351,"""""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent.""",Q351_R2_C7,Good,It's confusing sometimes; when your bill for a small tiny service is only 20 or 25 and then you have to leave a tip....ofcourse not less than 10 Riyals. I usually do not exceed 15 Riyals for services worth 100. But since most of the times you'll need more than one emplyee for more than one service;then 10 is fine for each one.

A mani-pedicure costs me 100-150 (with spa/massage) and I tip the girl 10-20 riyals. Why? Coz to clean my feet and nails would take at least an hour; plus cleaning the ingrown without causing you to bleed; wounded...is a feat. (no pun intended). These women who works in the salon works from 8:30AM to 11:00PM; no overtime pay; salary is about 1000-1500 a month and some of them only have HALF DAY offs. They are provided with accommodation and Free transportation but they buy their own food. The measly tip they get helps to augment what they earn. A little generosity wont hurt; right?

I have enough of the local population egocentric driving habits. 3- Don't be smelling like Garlic or some lost flowering fragrance; it just gives me a headache.

3348,Q351,"""""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do?

I don't even know if 'service' actual means the waiter service. Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not. If they don't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it; for the amount you think they deserve. I hate the American culture of always tipping. A normal tip should reward normal service; with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations. But if the service is poor (as it so often is here) then they haven't earnt a tip in my opinion.

So hopefully I just have to turn up. (Famous last words!) I will finally be arriving in Doha on Saturday morning. What about tipping in Doha?? Is it usual practice to tip taxi drivers in Doha? What about tipping in general; who to tip and how much? This is my first time in Doha and the Middle East so don't want to make any mistakes or offend/upset people. Thanks again for any advice.

3373,Q351,"""""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent.""",Q351_R20_C4,Good,You can most certainly use your cash card; providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus; etc.) or has a credit card symbol. I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). As for an ATM in arrivals; unfortunately; I've not seen one. I may have missed it; though; as I've been wisked through by the greeting service both times. If you are going to a hotel first; you can either use an ATM or take cash and exchange it. I did this (exchanged cash) the first time at the Intercon(tinental) without difficulty. Just ask when you check in. If you are going to your accommodation; malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan (1 am or so). Ask your driver for advice. City Center Doha (the big mall); which I live across from; is like this. 10 minutes and the money problem is solved. Established shops will take a credit card should you need to make a purchase before you can get to the ATM. However; Doha is pretty wired. You ca.....

The company have arranged limo to collect me and my son from the airport and to take us to the hotel. I was not sure if I would need to tip the driver or not. I think that I will just use my card to withdraw cash from my UK bank account when I first get to Doha so that I have some cash to use for small purchases and I will pay for larger purchases with my card. Thanks again for your help.
3375,Q351,"""""Do you do it; and how much do you leave if you do? Back home we leave 15 -20 percent.""",Q351_R20_C6,Good,Mmm... well; I can see your point there. However; as you're just arriving in the country; no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute. Or I'd hope not. Besides; the ATM spits out bigger bills than you'd tip to a driver (as in every country; UK included). So then you'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down. If you're going to the hotel; and you really want to tip the driver; just ask him to wait for a second. Run in; tell them what you want to do; and change a bill. Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop; tell them you're changing money in just a second; and then give it back after you've changed money. Truthfully; though; I wouldn't sweat it too much. You'll have other things to occupy yourself with. Which hotel? The Intercon is quite nice. The breakfast buffet is gigantic. Literally 15 kinds of bread (at least). Fresh fruit juices. A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses.

I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.

A mani-pedicure costs me 100-150 (with spa/massage) and I tip the girl 10-20 riyals. Why? Coz to clean my feet and nails would take at least an hour; plus cleaning the ingrown without causing you to bleed; wounded...is a feat. (no pun intended). These women who works in the salon works from 8:30AM to 11:00PM; no overtime pay; salary is about 1000-1500 a month and some of them only have HALF DAY offs. They are provided with accommodation and Free transportation but they buy their own food. The measly tip they get helps to augment what they earn. A little generosity wont hurt; right?

First; Iâ€™m a local. So; I might not be fair in giving you a clear opinion about us. Well; like every society there is the good; bad & the ugly. According to statistics; the highest percentage of the population is concentrated on the ages 20-30. Unfortunately; youâ€™ll find allot of shallow youth wondering on shopping malls; with no interest in education; employment; religion or life matters.

From my previous post -------------- All the US iPhones that came on week 45 and after have the 1.1.2 firmeware; with the new bootloader version 4.6. Those phones can still be jailbroken and activated; but there is no software sim unlock solution yet. To find out the week on your iPhone check the 4th and 5th digit of serial number. This number can be found on the bottom of box in which you received the iPhone. if it is 45 and above then there is no software solution to unlock the phone right now; Hardware solution TurboSim is your only option I guess. If you Serial number indicates that it is less that 45 then your iPhone can be unlocked. If not your choices are 1. Use TurboSim or similar HW method to unlock. 2. Jailbreak the iPhone and use it like iPod touch till a software unlock method is published. hope this helps --------------

As you might have observed; in many aspects Qatar takes Dubai as a role model where such exit permit; 2 year ban etc does not exist and therefore the world love that place. Qatar; while trying to attract international attraction eventually has to remove such bondage rules. For example; the employees can keep their pass ports but they cannot exit the country without the consent of their employer sounds like an irony. If people come to work in Qatar on a 2 year contract; they should be given choice to renew or switch to another job after successfully completing the contract. I hope the perception of Qatar Govt will change eventually to catch the international attention..as a moderately free place.

But those days ideas of globalization; equality; freedom of speech; right to information and service were also not there. I fully agree with what you have mentioned of the malls ans labour camps. But someone has to voice such plights to the public in some reasonable way. At least that we are discussing this issue now.. may be some one else would discuss this in another plat form where there could be a wider audience. Thus I think you and I can do something for the society if not a fundamental change.

Yes it has the money to do it but it has taken other countries 500 years to change this much but they didn't have to swamp the countries with foreigners to do it. Imagine living in your own country and being outnumbered 8 to 1 by foreigners. That is not an easy change. Slowly things are getting better but don't expect overnight change to benefit your individual needs.

The development came after Apple warned earlier that the update would render “permanently inoperable” devices that had been unlocked by owners who wanted to choose which mobile network to use. – DPA http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=175573&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56

3867,Q356,Why isnt there an apple store in qatar?,Q356_R53_C8,Bad,another brotherly advice; if you will transact or buying something on the net; try to negotiate face-to-face. dont send money thru visa or western union.

3875,Q356,Why isnt there an apple store in qatar?,Q356_R70_C6,Good,And another point to note is that sizes which will actually fit Western people often don't fly off the racks as quickly in other countries. I loved going to Gap in Japan; as I could find clothes which actually fit me in the clearance section; without paying an arm and a leg. Normally I don't shop at Gap either; but it became a must-visit whenever I saw one. Can't wait to visit the Villagio again-- they took me to the Middle Eastern restaurant in Villagio for dinner on my second visit day; and then we strolled around for a bit afterwards. The whole Venice motif rocked!

I don't think it's necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad. I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem. Their staff is usually helpful; sometimes it can take more than 3 staff members to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you.

(Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....

I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.

Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after.

Are you a heavy person. Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....

Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.

""""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"""" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."""

If this has been started; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department; where you will be required to complete an application form.

Doha has plenty of nice restaurants to go to.  After eating; peace and relaxation is easy to find here... it's everywhere. Go for spa in Al Sharq.  Go have a drink... try the night life... try cinema 9 at city center one of those has nice couch... try horse back riding... learning how to motorbike... try skating... try moroccan food...  try indian food... filipino food... thai food... try playing a ps3... try wii... sorry.... got carried away....  hunt for new gadgets; doha has quiet good priced items.  laptops are cheaper here compared in most countries. The high demand for it has brought down the prices... if i wasn't able to help you still... there are lots of groups who always socialize every weekends... there's some nationalistic groups; art groups; religious groups; hobby groups... you'll be able to find them in book guides like marhaba/ qatar ha.....

Ask personal questions to the most snobish salesman at a snobish outlet. 2. Talk in a higly accented english with the same snobish salesman (rehearse beforehand- another way to kill time). 3. Give a fake smile to people at corniche. Make it snappy like a flash. 4. Make funny/scary faces at kids on corniche. 5. Make a list of all swear words you know and keep the list ready for use (in purse/besides phone/in your car). 6. If you are working than prepare a list of important phone numbers in the smallest font possible and stick it on your computer monitor with a bright sticker. Think and analyse the reaction of your work mates on weekends. Bye and cheers.

A weekend alone is not good; you need to meet someone or some friends to spend time with; then the weekend will be too short. Although there is much to do in Doha; it is boring doing it alone. Take up a new sport or hobby that involves meeting people. I started playing golf and met loads of people. Let me know how you get on. Rob

I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner; intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting; i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether. Plus; I make .....

All the rest of the British school claim they """"follow"""" the British curriculum. Who is there to monitor the school? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school; they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class. Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals. Sadly; the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the Principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints."""

For me ; no harm putting them into the waiting list & pray that you will get a place. To me there are other good ones like Doha College; Parkhouse; Sherbourne & Doha British School which you can consider. Due to personal preference; I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too. Alternatively you let your husband settled here first.. find a school before you guys come over. All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted. So whenever a place becomes available; do prepare to fly them immediately.

Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However; this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)

These four schools are also """"reasonably"""" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places.

What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel. What good does it do? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border. Worse of all; everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths. Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill. Use brain power not gun powder. Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders. These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths.

If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way; apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification; now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit.

Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs. Also depends on your expectations. There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher. Also; you should try to be more specific. For eg: in the question you placed; you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go. But you chose not to. In addition to this; most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies. So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying' jobs for expatriates. The private firm would not probably pay you as much. To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you. Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews. The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily access.....

But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.

I'm not familiar with special needs health facilities here in Doha so cannot give you a personal opinion; but the Marhaba magazine talks about to centres; so it might be a good starting point for you to enquiry about speech teraphy and assessment: Shafallah Centre: The opening of the centre's new state of the art facility in West Bay in 206 offers worldclass facilities and education for special needs children in Qatar.

I've lived here for 15 years -- I should know! My preschooler goes to see a Canadian lady who works with him on his speech delay/pronunciation problems once a week. She is licensed; qualified and very good. I pay out of pocket over $80/week for one hour of services for him. I would NOT recommend either Shafallah or The Learning Center. The former is for severely mentally disabled children (mostly locals) and the latter is a school but; again; populated mostly with locals and it's a watered-down curriculum with few genuinely-trained specialists on staff to deal with the types of things you're thinking of *they're mostly regular teachers who have had a few inservices on working with kids with ADD -- that's about it).

That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually.

In short you shouldn't have just one set of resume and always follow-up on your applications don't wait for the company to contact you. Hope this helps.

(not the same as yours) he will still remain under your sponsorship. or different option if his job is well paid and he will get good benefits like tickets and also housing allowance he can ask his new employer to be his sponsor

Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa (6 months); he won't be able to work with this type of visa. The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship. As for the Residence permit; you won't be able to obtain RP for him (which is necessary for the Work permit) under your sponsorship. So this is not an option for you. All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months. THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship.

Or at least get it in the contract that they will pay your Housing Rent Bill as the rents increase 25% every year. If they agree then the package is good unless you are not a heavy dirnker. Bilabong is on the spot with the rates. No.5 is optional and it would depend on the length of your stay. If you Rent-a-car it will be QR2000. If you stay for above 3yrs then it would be better if you buy QR2000 pm for 3yrs you can own the car (corolla/civic) & sell it for QR 25;000-30;000 when you leave Qatar. If your wife is here & she is not working it could be damn boring for her.

Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK; before coming over to Doha; I typed into google a question about; say; sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL. It was informative; but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering? For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up; as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted!

The wings cross section make it such that most of the air is forced downwards and smaller fraction over the wings; pushing the plane upwards. Air must be moving toward the plane for the wing to push it below. So the aircraft must be moving towards the air; to get this effect. for the smarter ones out there; you should know that; the speed at which the air hits the wings (basically the aircraft speed plus speed of opposing wind) is proportional to the amount of lift given. helicopters are the same; only that the rotor blades; are the wings and they constantly move in at circular path.

If yes; can anyone name a good rent a car company in Qatar?""""""",Q367_R55_C9,Good,Technically; a commercial jet can stay still in the air provided we cause the wind to blow at it from the opposite direction at over 600Kmph. This wind must blow towards the nose and through its wings to cause it to get lift force and thus not make any displacement relative to the ground. This wud means it has zero ground speed. An aircraft has two speeds namely groundspeed and airspeed. Airspeed is measured by the amount of air rushing thro' its sensors placed at various points on its outer body. This mechanism and physical aspect of flight is beyond the scope of this discussion and many of you won't even be able grasp the idea.

When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz

The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.

The bride ALWAYS looks terrified and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make- up on her face.  I really feel sorry for her.  One of the brides I saw; took about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of us as I don't think she could move with the dress she was wearing....   And you are right about the mobile thing...

Alcohol will be confiscated; no doubt about it; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner. I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again. Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here. I'm a white Western middleaged female. Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point. Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).

I'm going to Dubai tomorrow to cancel my visa and then I was planning to come back in my car. Will I be able to obtain the transit visa in Saudi border if I have a Canadian passport? 3. If I get an NOC from my employer in Qatar; will that be sufficient to import my car from Dubai to Doha. 4. Will I have to pay the 5% tax if my car is 3 yrs old? Is there any way to avoid it?

That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually.

But if someone goes on the current trend of TIGHT fitting ones with shiny stones and designs; without the Hijab; and with DRAG makeup or in some cases they just let it all fly back while they walk into a mall making it look like an advocate coat. So whats the purpose of wearing the Abaya again; if you want to show your body to the world? lol; when I see the other nationalities wearing an abaya apparently they dont do it to cover their body; they do it to look pretty and to look Qatari :) Correct me if Im wrong. Hope your not one among these people. Once I was in Landmark and I saw a Qatari (I guess) with an open Abaya wearing Super man tee inside. What the devil did she want to potray?

As DaRuDe said; 8 to 10 degrees. This may sound high; but when it rains or there is a wind; it feels much colder. I will second DaRuDe; last year; there was a shortage of room heaters in Qatar; people were even willing to pay a premium for a small one. Better to be prepared than spend sleepless night shivering with the cold. Granted the cold snap does not last long; but who would want to give up their sleep. Days are pretty warm. Last year; I think; it was about a day or three that was very cold during the day and that was due to heavy rains.

Practice this until you are no more; and no less than 180 degrees from when you started. . . . . 2. Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops. . . . . 3. Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable. . . . . . 4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping; hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone.

I'll liaise with Sek and try to find a venue. I suggest indoor would be best; as we may have to do it on a weekend after work when it'll be dark. Then we can organise weekend beach games after; if there is enough interest If any one has any suggestions on venues they would be gratefully received; as I'm new in Doha and don't really know my way around yet. Others; please keep leaving your calling cards and we'll make an announcement if and when we can organise something.

I am a native speaker from Palestine. I am educated but I have tutored Arabic for non-Arabic native speakers for many years during my stay in the States; whether for Arab Americans who do not speak Arabic well or Americans; Mexicans; Brasilians; Europeans and some Asians. I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner; intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting; i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether.

5614,Q374,do U know Place to learn Arabic ?,Q374_R32_C5,PotentiallyUseful,English is not an easy language - but Arabic is much more difficult . Once I read from an expert that learning Arabic needs ten times more time and effort than learning English for example . The big problem is not the letters - they are easy to learn - but the words ... There are so many dialects that you have to choose one dialect first of all . Or if you choose the standard Arabic then you will understand speakers of news channels or religious teachers - but you will not be able to communicate or they will just laugh at you .... Sometimes it seems to me that there is not such thing that Arabic language . There are dialects which are similar to each other like French is similar to Italian or to Spanish .

5682,Q374,do U know Place to learn Arabic ?,Q374_R80_C3,Bad,nice idea but unfortunately the way adults and children learn language is different what about trying just to learn lots of vocab whilst you are driving....????
5683,Q374,do U know Place to learn Arabic ?,Q374_R80_C4,Bad,Right oryx; learning a lot of vocab can be a good starter but you have to use it amongst Arabic speakers to gain confidence...during my college i learnt lot of french and then when i went to france I could ask questions in french but had tough time understanding what they replied....so yeah; i guess a mix of both approaches would help.

The only options available were at Qatar university but I am not sure about its credentials and the second option was National education center somewhere near Lulu. They offer MBA evening classes couple of times a week and the degree we get is from Allagappa university of Madras. The third option is Doha Training Center; they had an ad in the papers a few weeks ago. They too are offering MBA thu some American university or atleast that is what they claimed but when I went there to check it out; it turned out to be some American university based in the Phillipines. Even the degree that we would get after completing it would say Phillipines on it. So I decided that it is better to do some distance MBA from my own country Pakistan than to go for that.. If any of you find out some good and recognized MBA degree being offered in Qatar; please let me know. Thanks

5851,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R35_C2,Good,Buy new...check in sofitel they have lots of laptops there or in jarir bookstore should cost u anywhere between 2500 to 5000 depending on specs.
5852,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R35_C3,Good,Yes you can upgrade the ram in your laptop. This day and age; 512mb is the minimum for a good experience. If you can afford it; I say buy a new laptop with at least 1gb ram and a good processor. You don't game or do any media editting so you don't need to worry about having a speedy processor or a great graphics card. Watch out though if you get vista. Although it's supposed to be better; I find that XP is much better. OR if you wanted a great all in one solution. Get a Macbook.

5874,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R41_C5,Good,It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.
5875,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R41_C6,Good,"""I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris.

What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be """"unskilled"""" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."""

5880,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C1,Good,Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers... I'm absolutly no help am I? lol~ sorry :(
5881,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C2,Good,I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.

I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....
5883,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C4,Bad,What is the problem; I would maybe have a few doubts about the Pearl just becasue its reclaimed land but my tower built on solid ground out of concrrete. I think it will be ok for some time to come. The finishing in this country is appauling but you can't argue that the building are not solid.
5884,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C5,Good,Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.
5885,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C6,Bad,Please clarify: Those buildings will not last long; have you not noticed how they are built?????
5886,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C7,PotentiallyUseful,I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?
5887,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C8,PotentiallyUseful,Forget Lusail; its not worth it.

5889,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R46_C10,Good,"""You sound pretty vague in your confidence; When you say """"I hope"""" and """"I think"""" but you conclude pretty confidently with the term """"no-brainer"""". The prices of Lagoon are above a million for a one bed appartment. Such prices in the heart of Dubai Marina have now crashed to 0.55 million. Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation. The other factor that has literally killed the Dubai market is the very high figure of Annual maintenance charges of about 10AED/Sq ft/Year. Please share your analysis with us.

Unfortunately; there are apparently not enough internal QP resources to adequately screen all on-line candidates; so your best chance is to know somebody within QP who can apply a little pressure to move your file to the forefront. If Mystica is willing to help you on this front; I would say go for it.

5898,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R56_C9,Bad,I have seen many well qualified job seekers not even considered for interviews at companies like QP and RASGAS while people with NO EXPEREINCE and hardly any qualification get into good posts there just because they know some on in the recruitment division. This is really unfair to those who spent years trying to build a great career and get a good position in some good company.
5899,Q376,if ill handle all the expenses of my tourist visa? how much would it range? estimate amount?,Q376_R56_C10,Good,Here's a tip; you should first read the job requirement and qualifications; then you should cater your resume/CV to what they're looking for. Most big companies don't really have real people going through those resumes/CV; they have a software that look for keywords. In short you shouldn't have just one set of resume and always follow-up on your applications don't wait for the company to contact you. Hope this helps. If anyone needs help on there resume/CV; I can always spare some time to look it over. JhunBug

Good luck and go for it. Take my advise dont focus on present cost of living as these are highly volatile and misleading when I decided to come over in Doha April this year; it was based on good savings but in realty I found it other way round. I think when deciding about taking a job in Gulf; criteria these days should be better opportunity and quality of life and these two things no other city in Gulf provides except great Abu Dhabi.

After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....

6030,Q378,What would be a good website to start at Qatar? Any inputs or experience based informed comments would be welcome!,Q378_R22_C1,Good,A PMP certificate is not worth the paper it is printed on. Employers want experience; a construction/project management degree and evidence that you started a project and completed a project. I have reviewed many cv's and the majority of people with PMPs have simply not delivered projects; they have been involved; spent a long time ghetting all sorts of qualifications but when you ask them about the basics of project management their lack of practical; varied experience; shines through.

6033,Q378,What would be a good website to start at Qatar? Any inputs or experience based informed comments would be welcome!,Q378_R22_C4,Good,In my opinion it is good. I've been working as a PM n doing reasonably well.. but on taking the PMP course; I discovered loads of information on how U can better do the job. That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted. Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with. Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently. Of cos experience also counts. I am curious how these so called PMPs got their certificate if they cant even vouch for some basic experience. All depends on individual dedication. I wud say go for it. Good luck.

What I am doing is that; i am the one who is in charge of the trains while my wife is the one who's constructing the models (stations; bridges; etc..). We're still waiting for the accessories that we need to construct our first diorama set (1200x600mm). try to go to miniatur wunderland website to check the largest modeltrain assembled.
6046,Q378,What would be a good website to start at Qatar? Any inputs or experience based informed comments would be welcome!,Q378_R29_C7,Good,A few of the choices you need to answer before you get started are: What scale would you want to work with? What era or region of train type? How much space do you have for a layout? The two most popular scales are HO and N gauge; they would have the most accessories available for building a layout. With N gauge you could make a nice little layout on a desktop size area or smaller. With HO scale; you would need at least 2 desktop sized areas to make a small layout on.

Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?

On a serious note - english (with absolute ZILTCH grammer); hindi (not what we speak in India); Urdu; malliyali and Arabic to a great extent is common language here
6098,Q378,What would be a good website to start at Qatar? Any inputs or experience based informed comments would be welcome!,Q378_R42_C9,PotentiallyUseful,some companies here prefer marketing executives speaking malayalam and english only. qtel; qpost; trafic dept etc having their advertisements in arabic; malayalam; english and urdhu. I think hindi and urdu almost same but how many people here can read urdu?
6099,Q378,What would be a good website to start at Qatar? Any inputs or experience based informed comments would be welcome!,Q378_R42_C10,PotentiallyUseful,Good Morning; Unfortunately; this is a melting pot for different languages Tagalog; Hindi; Urdu; Arabic and English please forgive any languages I forgot. Now not wishing to offend anyone but Arabic and English are the main business languages; however; Indians have derived their onw english after the British left and even I have difficulty understanding many of them. Wen I go to a shope and there is and Indian salesman I have to aske at least three times what he is saying ans this is meant seriously; there are other whose English is wonderful. Most people in Government positions are well versed in English although I have to admit we there are a nuber of employees who speak very little English. You seem to have encountered the very few that don't speak english. May I add this comment here; many more Arabs speak English than English speaking races speak Arabic.

6243,Q380,Hi friends... Do you have any update regarding Villagio's opening?,Q380_R18_C4,Bad,Soniya this is ridiculous rule . It is not the same in UAE or Oman or Bahrain or not even in KSA where i stayed alone for a couple of years . In Doha ; last summer -when my family was out of Qatar ; i was at office on friday and wanted to go to carrefour to buy something-villagio security blocked me .

6245,Q380,Hi friends... Do you have any update regarding Villagio's opening?,Q380_R18_C6,Good,Fridays 10AM - 8PM no entry for bachelors in the malls. I have stayed in Saudi; and ofcourse they do not have such rules coz they are closed on any given day (except after 8pm or so). They too have family days; and even in the parks only families are allowed. Next; i have been to the malls all by myself and noone ever stopped me on a friday. Irrespective of what time i went. This rule is to keep those perverts away who have nothing better to do but stare at women during their free time!

Or you could join one of the nearby hotel clubs. The villa compound life is more suited towards families. Think suburbia vs. city life. It can easily take 45 minutes to get from Villagio to West Bay. Traffic is the #1 headache in Doha.
6270,Q380,Hi friends... Do you have any update regarding Villagio's opening?,Q380_R25_C1,Good,As per rules; yes its family day on Fridays. But whether you would actually be barred from entry depends upon various factors like your nationality; security guard on duty and your luck. :-)

6284,Q380,Hi friends... Do you have any update regarding Villagio's opening?,Q380_R27_C5,Bad,Don't worry; Qatari's do a good job of wearing fashionable clothes as well as traditional clothes :) I don't really like GAP; but I do like their stretch shirts (which I like to wear under a t-shirt). If their prices are the same as the US; then I'm happy! In the UK; their prices are crazy!!! __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net
6285,Q380,Hi friends... Do you have any update regarding Villagio's opening?,Q380_R27_C6,Good,And another point to note is that sizes which will actually fit Western people often don't fly off the racks as quickly in other countries. I loved going to Gap in Japan; as I could find clothes which actually fit me in the clearance section; without paying an arm and a leg. Normally I don't shop at Gap either; but it became a must-visit whenever I saw one. Can't wait to visit the Villagio again-- they took me to the Middle Eastern restaurant in Villagio for dinner on my second visit day; and then we strolled around for a bit afterwards. The whole Venice motif rocked!

The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name.

I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.

I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship.

Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C1,PotentiallyUseful,Good point......New in town;me and my friend are facing same problem......why they complicate things .I heard karwa is very clear about it and tell clearly everything at the time of admission.
6511,Q383,Is it advantage to take a drive test in the holy month of Ramadan? Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C2,Good,Actually as for my case; since I have my valid license in my home; I am entitled for a half course or direct test. Full course may be required if you don't have existing license or expired. Otherwise; no driving school will require a full course. There are a lot of driving schools out there; Al rayya driving school; karwa; etc.
6512,Q383,Is it advantage to take a drive test in the holy month of Ramadan? Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C3,Good,I also have driving licence(from home country) and go for short course but after having pre-test (which is not mandatory)they forced for full course and according to other student it is their practice especially for short course student and important is they never tells students about such so called pre-test at the time of admission after having few classes they inform you about pre-test which is unfair........ while with karawa after completed the classes you can go directly for test with police department(which is quite normal).
6513,Q383,Is it advantage to take a drive test in the holy month of Ramadan? Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C4,Good,Rayan driving school is good ; I had a very good experience with them and I have already forwarded few of my team mates for driving classes there .
6514,Q383,Is it advantage to take a drive test in the holy month of Ramadan? Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C5,Bad,Notice rodqie76; he mention that they forcibly or tactfully impose long/full course through so called pre test;and they refuse students to go for the test with traffic department; and after giving admission fee no one think to go any other institute. Why don't they allow direct test with traffic dept;Let them decide who can drive or not.don't pressurize for long course!! Make each and every thing clear at the time of admission. Anyone can help or suggest how to stop out from such situation????
6515,Q383,Is it advantage to take a drive test in the holy month of Ramadan? Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C6,Good,So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule. Point is if traffic department allows for short course or direct test why they take pre-test and enforce for full course. It is good only for those who are not sure either they can drive properly or not!!!not for all......... any way Congratulations you got your licence after having full course.
6516,Q383,Is it advantage to take a drive test in the holy month of Ramadan? Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C7,Good,Good point razingbull.....but the question comes in mind about the credibility and quality of rest of the institute!!!!and in that case the leverage given by traffic department is just waste because they allow such students to go directly to the TEST..........not enforced pre-test.
6517,Q383,Is it advantage to take a drive test in the holy month of Ramadan? Pls put share your ideas......,Q383_R11_C8,Good,"""You are lucky Razingbull......if these are quality measures why they are hiding at the time of admission if someone insist to pay exam fee at the same time they said you will pay three days before exams.....why they are showing such double standards;if they are quality conscious then must inform to students """"if you pass pre-test then institute allows you to go for test if you agree then take admission"""" other wise they are over ruling the permission given by government/traffic department which allows for direct test or short course."""

Before the seven-day period is up; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa.

Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.

The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter. QF is pretty fair about pay; and is an employer of choice in Qatar.

The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager (in the admininstration department; not just a floor section manager in the store) next time you are there; and inquire about the brand specifically.

Garvey's was not close; they had to shut the doors to outsider obnoxious drunks from coming in; like your own friend. That place was loud and kicking it; last night. I had to pick up one of my best friend last night; He had too much to drink at 0200 am. He could not drive back.

He actually rents a villa at Garvey's. Had just bought a bottle of champagne ready to see in the New Year when the police arrived. He had to leave it there so was a bit pissed off!! The DJ was telling people to leave; that it was not a joke. Maybe your friend was drinking at one of the houses/apartments on Garvey's compound?

That massive and squalid shanty town. The Center was the only decent large shop and it had BHS as one of its franchises although many of the items for sale were not BHS products; just BHS labels sewn on in the wrong place. There was a Shwarma stall in the car park and a cafe inside that served many dishes. Both were operated by """"The Caravan"""". The only other shop of any size was Salam Studios; on Al-Saad Street. Now the site of the QP offices and HSBC. Salam Plaza didn't open until the early/mid 80's I seem to recollect. If there was something that you wanted and couldn't find; Globe China was the place to go."""

I've often wondered exactly the same thing but I've never gotten around to asking it. I would love to know more about what life was like before the malls but also before Doha was the chaotic city it is now.

Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices; perfumes; material for clothing; nuts; etc) Now they deliver to us! But we still go once in a while. I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back. Clothes; shoes; medicines; foodstuffs...endless list. Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier. Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night. Someone came along to light the gaslamps (?) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day. Dweller; you've got a good memory...I had forgotten about Salam Studios on Al Sadd St. My Dad used to shop there a lot. I remember when.....
