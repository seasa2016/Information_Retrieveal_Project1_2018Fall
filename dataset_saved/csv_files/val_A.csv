They include: -Current Accounts facilities -Savings Account facilities - Money Transfer (However; I highly recommend using the bank transfer only in emergency cases.

39,Q268_R13,Hi everybody; I need to open a bank account as soon as possible. Can you please advise on the best bank to deal with here? Thanks,Q268_R13_C10,PotentiallyUseful,Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.

Regards;,Q268_R16_C4,Good,Well Arman; nothing is wrong here with banks; I feel they are not up to par with UAE bank in terms of service at least not with the best which is abu dhabi islamic bank; but I have made an extensive review of QIB; IBQ; QNB and CBQ. I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.

Regards;,Q268_R16_C10,Good,Sheabi; the reason behind it; is that most people in QL have very low income; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers...Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship. Because like everywhere you got some lazy people and you want to avoid them.

Have a nice weekend everyone.,Q268_R29_C10,Good,Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards

157,Q269_R27,Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.,Q269_R27_C8,Good,I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant.

158,Q269_R27,Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.,Q269_R27_C9,Good,"""Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. """"Sandy"""" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."""

Is it near to Corniche ?,Q270_R47_C9,Bad,Why there? I have enjoyed many visits to the island; and was under the illusion that it was there for everyone to enjoy. I could be wrong; but it would seem that it is probably going to be out of bounds to casual visitors in future. On the flip side; the island is man made. So I guess whoever made it must have had a good reason to pop an island right next to a massive new shiny international airport; and this is probably it. In which case; the owners can do what they like with their island. Well there ya go; I have answered my own question.

There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong.

THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have.... May be it's just me and i don't have any intention to discourage you to get a cheaper car if budget is a concern of yours. Have a safe and joyful weekend.

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more.

This is an all in pay i.e I would have to take care of my housing also Also what is the cost of car rental / Loan in Qatar ?,Q271_R24_C10,PotentiallyUseful,I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.

How does it compare to Qatar? Tell me about it... (Desperately trying to find a Cairoliving website!),Q271_R59_C1,Good,The one thing you can be certain of is that Cairo is not Doha!!! We are talking about a city of over 12million where the traffic is so bad (if you think Doha is bad...just wait) its actually comical. There is also no system and it is one of the most frustrating places to live in. Hope you are based in Zamalek or Maadi which are the nicest parts. But the lack of a system and the 'pushiness' of the egyptians will make you angry and frustrated.The poverty is also striking. And yet; and yet; in one street of Cairo you will find more charm; more magic and more life than the whole of Doha. It is a crazy place but a place which loves music and a place which is confident of itself (not surprising given its ancient history). It has the soul which Doha so lacks and because of that you put up with the traffic and frustrations. Egypt is a beguiling country which captured the heart of more than one roman emperor and many kings. Keep that in mind as you deal with the settling in period and once you .....

Celestvile; sounds like all the expat community lives in Maadi; and whilst I have heard that it is a quiet area with lots of greenery; I doubt it's convinient for us to live there as it is quite a ride from Giza; where my husband works. We shall see...we heard 6 October area is also nice? Besides; our housing allowance will only be $1500; which I think doesn't strech for a place in Maadi; and after living in a small flat for the last three years; I'm looking forward to a big place with a garden. By the way; do you have any idea where the french school is located? Dweller; oh god; now you worried me...with that kind of money I could live anywhere . Wonder why your son didn't like it. PM; yes I noticed that too (The $ sign); sounds like I will get ripped off quite often; then. So your friends dislike living in Cairo?

Thanks so much! Kiki,Q271_R71_C2,Bad,Thanks; how awesome; I was thinking it was more like 1.5 hours from what everyone has said about Doha traffic!! :) Being here in the USA is a bit difficult to find out what areas are best to live in Doha... My husband and I love being at home; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best. We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority. Given this; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend? We don't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it (to and from new DOHA airport). What information is there out there about the Pearl; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from? Are shoping areas and restaurants nearby already finished? Thanks so much! Kiki

Lusail is a """"planned new city"""" due to open soon but you go there now; all you'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes. Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems. Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city. You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare (not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style). If no traffic; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive. The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel.

The only vehcile imports I have done in Doha previously was for the Oilfield Market; and is done slightly differently. You might be surprised; I seen a couple of big bike shops here in Doha when I visted a few weeks back. Anyhow; in Dubai a few years ago; I imported some choppers from the guys off Discovery Channel program. The Duty was 5% of the CIF Value. (eg. Bike is US $20000 CIF then Duty will be US $1000) I then had to pay a local agent commission on the import of US $1500 each as they held the import licence agreements for the bikes. Therafter; Police Inspection; Registration and other details were approx. $1200 per bike. Then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax; which I believe is approx. $100 per month in Doha.

You have to see it to believe it. Seriously most people see a car crash every single day. Riding motorcycles on the streets in Doha is only for fools in my opinion.

No public display of affection and you must dress up modestly. If you think 2000 riyals is enough savings for you then good luck and welcome to Doha.

400,Q272_R8,Hi all; I've finally received the official offer from QP and I think I'm being lowballed. The offer is QR23;000 + 14;200 housing and school and benefits. They put me in grade 16. I don't know anything about these grades. Can anyone enlight me and tell me also how much I can negotiate? I read some mixed discussions about the leeway I have for negotiation. I was expecting QR35;000 basic; realistic?. Thx in advance,Q272_R8_C1,Good,35;000 is out of reach for grade 16; however; there is always a room for negotiation provided that you afford risking the job as they aren't normally that keen have a particular applicant for the job. They don't even care if it takes them more couple of months to fill the vacancy.

I don't know anything about these grades. Can anyone enlight me and tell me also how much I can negotiate? I read some mixed discussions about the leeway I have for negotiation. I was expecting QR35;000 basic; realistic?. Thx in advance,Q272_R8_C3,Good,Realisticly you are making $6;300 per month; with paid accommodation and free children's education etc etc. I don't see how you are being low balled when the majority of your basic income is going to be savings because your overheads are being paid for by QP already. Even if your current job position you are making more then $6300; the chances of saving anything are highly unlikely. Also remember their are promotions; yearly appraisals and the big fat bonus's every year. If you do the annual gross income on your basic salary with the above you could be pulling easily 28;000-30;000 per month :) Don't miss this opportunity!! Most ppl on QL dream to have a offer like this!! Good luck!

I was expecting QR35;000 basic; realistic?. Thx in advance,Q272_R8_C5,Good,Normally QP does not negotiate packages; it is either you take it or leave it. They have hundreds of applicants looking to join QP. That salary is a lower end of grade 16. Normally there is no promotion in QP unless you are a Qatari or someone within GCC and you do get bonuses depending on your rating. Your annual bonus for an everage rating on your salary is around 34000 QAR and after 4 years you get 6000 QAR furniture maintenance annually. On top of the salary they will give you an expatriate allowance of about 3000 per month depending on which european country you come from and a car allowance of QAR 2000.00 per month. So basically its not bad.

Thx in advance,Q272_R8_C7,Good,takes care of your single biggest expense.I'm not a QP employee so could be wrong; but dont they take care of tuition for upto 4 kids? US/UK schools here will cost you north of QAR 40K annually....and that is for PRE-K !!!! As to whether they are low-balling you;maybe. But without knowing details of your qualifications;current pay etc its hard to tell.Take into consideration the point I've made about schooling expense and those made by others on this thread. That said; I will say there is always room for a counter-offer.Just be smart with the number you go backto them with.Also depends on how much of a hard-ass the person you are dealing with is and at this point;I would imagine you have some idea.

If you are a professional (engineer) with years of experience and a senior management position; it's garbage. One note - school fees and housing (depending on where and how you wish to live) can be very expensive. Do some research on school fees and look at ads for the type of housing you would find satisfactory. Your question can be answered; if you provide more details on your education/experience and what job you are being offered.

We are making here more than what was offered; that's why we are thinking to counter offer as I'm gonna be the only one working there. Can anyone who knows QP policies tell me what amount to ask for to get a good trade-off; and if I can ask for grade jump from 16 to 17? As reminder I was offered 23k basic. Thx

Also their offer might increase by 2000 or so but won't be significantly different. As to the grade increase; this is not very likely as they cannot have someone doing the same job on a different grade. Creates a lot of problems for them

If you must then i would put a bit of your own salary into securing the type of residence you really want; like novita77 said i would think 15000QR would get you a very nice place. you would still have plenty of cash left over to """"live it up"""" esp if they are also giving you a car allowance like you stated in your post.

I will appreciate if any can help me. Regards;,Q272_R40_C2,Good,NEXT STEP... I have explained this earlier and I will repeat it again..so that no one gets caught in an uncomfortable situation....Getting an offer and submitting a medical in QP is NOT a signal to move...Until you get the final offer letter and see the visa in your Inbox..DO NOT RESIGN..I am sure in their Email offer to you they will advise you not to resign until told... In QP things move according to your mobilization date..and getting your VISA is not a big deal for QP...However the actual date of mobilization is pre-determined..... QP is usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at times... The next step in your recruitment process is waiting and asking questions if you have any...Your VISA Could be ready in 1 month..or it can also be 4 months..so just wait..and DO NOT RESIGN from your current job....

510,Q273_R5,hi all. I am planning on coming to doha with my 3 week old baby who has only got her BCG vaccination. I am wondering if its advisble to come and get the rest of her immunisations there in doha; or is it better for me to get them done here before travelling there to doha? has any one had their child vaccinated here in doha? thanks in advance xoxo,Q273_R5_C1,Good,I would get all the vaccinations done before you come. There are lots of good hospitals here; so it is not a problem. However; I think you need proof of vaccination in small kids before you entry the country. I may be wrong. My thoughts are my own; but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.

You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them. Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha (born here; now 1 and 3). The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return. Each country has different vaccine schedules. But; if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here. For example; in the US they don't do BCGs; but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it. I'm pretty sure you don't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha. Check with your employer; but I can't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they don't check vaccines for adults at all!

Hamad; Doha Clinic and Al Ahli... We didn't have insurance for a while; and we also wanted to try different places to find the best one. If you don't have insurance; I'd recommend the local clinic of Hamad. The vaccines are free there for babies under 1. They only do vaccines a couple of times a week; so make sure you stop by first to check the hours (you'll need a medical # first; so bring the baby's RP; birth certificate; etc). You won't find many westerners there (or perhaps that's just my local branch) but they speak english well enough and it's free! If you do have insurance; I like Doha Clinic. Staff is helpful and friendly (except Dr Khalid; he's a bit harsh- yelled at my mom once for trying to come to the appointment with me) and there isn't much of a wait.

Thanks,Q273_R7_C5,Good,please consider another hospital.. they are not experienced and are not capable nor have any facilities to take care of your baby; if there are any complications. I will pm you further details; since i have to leave now. Many serious incidents have occured there over the past weeks and as much as 5-6 babies have had to be rushed to Hamad Hospital because of gross medical negligence on the part of Al Ahli Hospital. I personally know of 1 baby who is still in the NCU of Hamad Hospital now; that had to be transferred from Al-Ahli. Stay far away from al-Ahli hospital and consider Hamad Hospital. Do you want to go to AL-Ahli because u have the money or because u really care for your baby?

Did you actually gave birth on hamad or other hospital to say that or this is like that kind of stuff that you hear somebody saying and reapeat as if was realy truth?? I'm asking because chosing a hospital/doctor far away from your home country is a very dificult decision; and al ahli hospital doesn't look like the kind of place you described. I like to hear from someone who actually delivered there. Is there anyone?? Thanks

They are rude and broke her water - without her approval. She was emotionally and phsycologically abused by the nurses there. They wouldn't call her doctor when she was asked them to. We had to call her from our personal mobiles. Not a very pleasant experience. I'm having all my children at Hamad Medical.

550,Q273_R33,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C1,PotentiallyUseful,The carseat law here is a joke. The fine for having a child in your lap in the front seat is the same as talking on a hand-held cell phone! I've asked our pediatrician why there hasn't been an all out education campaign but no one knows. 25-year-behind syndrome I guess. Carseats are available though.
551,Q273_R33,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C2,Good,You get a good selection of car seats here. Try Toys 'R Us; Babyshop or Mothercare.
552,Q273_R33,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C3,Good,I highly suggest putting your young ones in a car seat! Have you seen the driving? Not to mention the amount of accidents that happen everyday! Children are our most precious gifts; and we need to protect and keep them safe! I have seen good ones at Toys R Us! Good Luck! Also try consumer reports for the newest and greatest!
553,Q273_R33,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C4,Good,Never heard about car seat law ... but i still recommend you putting your little on into car seat for their safety; not for fear of the law. Plenty of choice ... most shops like baby shop are toys r us sell them.

As far as carseats go; I sent a letter to the Sheikha. I think there needs to be a law that to leave the hospital when you have a baby; you must have a car seat. It should be checked by the hospital.
555,Q273_R33,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C6,PotentiallyUseful,We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?

Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C8,Bad,Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.
558,Q273_R33,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C9,PotentiallyUseful,Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant; I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule. I totally s.....
559,Q273_R33,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q273_R33_C10,Bad,I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.
560,Q273_R39,I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.,Q273_R39_C1,Good,Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.

I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.,Q273_R39_C4,Good,It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.

I think you should be good as long as you have had the ones you had as a child. And even if you didn't; your body has an immune system so it will be able to fight off the most not so serious diseases. TB would be smart to have though!

I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.,Q273_R39_C8,Good,As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?

If anything happened to the dogs; my husband would die; and he will not leave them in Canada if we go away. So I have to be sure they would be ok to be imported before considering taking a job.,Q273_R76_C7,Bad,Thank you and it's good to know that there are some moral and responsible pitty owners in Qatar; some of the web sites I've seen make me sick at how people are taking these normally people loving animals and misusing and abusing them for sport (and then people who aren't informed blame the dogs who are the ones being abused; not the ones doing the abusing in the first place).

This may sound high; but when it rains or there is a wind; it feels much colder. I will second DaRuDe; last year; there was a shortage of room heaters in Qatar; people were even willing to pay a premium for a small one. Better to be prepared than spend sleepless night shivering with the cold. Granted the cold snap does not last long; but who would want to give up their sleep. Days are pretty warm. Last year; I think; it was about a day or three that was very cold during the day and that was due to heavy rains.

I'm pretty new here in Qatar and I've been in search for a lap pool nearby where I can continue my training...or at least keep myself fit. After reading several posts here; seems like those that are easily accessible (for a fee) are hotel pools. As for running; the only route I've tried so far is at the Corniche. I usually start near the Sheraton hotel and go the opposite end then back. Biking on the other hand...haven't tried yet as I didn't bring my bike here. My friends advised me not to since it's not a safe place to bike - due to the hot weather and also crazy drivers on the road. Although I'm still planning to buy a bike eventually and look for a long stretch of road outside the city where one can go cover several kms during the cold season.

I just want to get back in shape.,Q274_R60_C2,Bad,do you guys know where to find road bike shops here in doha? not to mention mechanics and parts... i have a regular beach swim site but i get to be active only when the weather cools down... soon it will come. sad to say my fitness level is at the lowest now. i think my swim place is safe enough for road bike laps during early weekend mornings... i really love to push ahead with brick works; let say swim/bike or swim/run... do you guys want to start from scratch as a tri-group??
672,Q274_R60,Anybody out here doing Triathlon? Can you suggest the best pool around Doha to do Lap swimming? Safest route for biking and running? I just want to get back in shape.,Q274_R60_C3,Bad,"""I am a hard core triathlete - and considering moving to Doha - I train about 20 hours per week - I've trained in Vegas during the summer; and while the heat isn't ideal; it is doable. I also train in New York City; and while the traffic and cars are not great - I've survived so far. What I need is a stretch of road that is at least wide; if not quiet. I need to ride between 80 and 120 miles on the weekends. A loop of 40 miles that I can do 3 times would work - but I need a decent shoulder or a place that isn't too busy - Is there such a thing as a """"country road"""" near Doha? Is swimming in the ocean permitted? Can women swim too? Are there any lap pools? Maybe at the universities? When I train I usually wear the typical tri-outfit - is this going to be a problem? What about for women trainers?"""

John - you don't need full on winter gear. Just a couple of jumpers; trousers (of course); a medium coat; and maybe a scarf.
695,Q274_R68,i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?,Q274_R68_C6,Good,In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.

698,Q274_R68,i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?,Q274_R68_C9,PotentiallyUseful,Yes; you'll definitely want a heater cos the build quality of the houses/apartments is atrocious. The cold air and wind will whistle through the poorly sealed windows and ill-fitting doors. JJ - I don't know which is worse; being trapped in Doha or going back to Dukhan ;-)
699,Q274_R68,i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?,Q274_R68_C10,Good,winter here in Qatar is very nice; sunny in the morning and afternoon; cool at night. some times you feel of cold and you need heater. but in general; it is lovely season. at least you can enjoy walking

QAWS (shutting down end of September; so please consider this your first stop as they have tons of animals to rehome); 2nd Chance Rescue; Cats in Qatar; and Qatar Veterinary Center. Look them all up on Facebook for news and pictures of their current adoptable cats. Some ask a small fee to cover money already spent on the cats spaying/neutering; microchip and vaccination costs; and some are completely free. 2. Depending on the kind of cat and where you go; it can be from 75QR to as much as 250QR for grooming. More reputable places such as the big vets (Parkview & QVC) will charge more. 3. Anywhere from 100-500QR depending on what you need done.

I would really appreciate some help!!! Alyson,Q275_R24_C4,Good,Alyson; you can get Royal Canin for cats here; I always buy the hairball control at Doha Vets. If they don't have the specific for persians; they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest; if you use an enclosed litter box; bring one with you; as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys; they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh; and frontline is also quite expensive here; and I haven't found the specific one for cats; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway; those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.

Please let me know; if anyone has bought a pup from this place. Also; let me know if it can be kept in a flat ...since its quite small. I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.,Q275_R34_C1,PotentiallyUseful,NO! A one month old puppy isn't old enough to leave its mother and anyone selling it knows nothing about dogs or their care or their health. You will be getting a sick dog that will cost you tens of thousands of riyals over the next months or years.

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.,Q275_R34_C3,Good,A better and more deserving place to get a pup is from the Animal care centre - it used to be called 'Paws and Claws' - not sure what it is called now. We got a Saluki pup from there for our daughter and he is now a grown dog; an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house. When we got him; he was not even a month old and his eyes were not yet foccused. I understand his parents were running wild on a farm and the cops came; rounded them up and shot the parents; but Paws and Claws saved many of the orphaned pups and brought them to their centre. We paid them only QR 100/-as donation for the pup. He had diarrohea and needed treatment thereafter. There are good vetinary clincs in Doha; but still it is a bit expensive. Even then; it is worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle; hug and love. If things go rough in school and her friends and teachers are mean; the dog is someone she would try to confide in; althought is cannot speak back.....

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.,Q275_R34_C4,Good,Buying a dog/puppy for your daughter is a very big decision. You have to consider many things before you decide on something. We have got a Shiranian (ShihTzu+Pom) for our 3yr old son; believe it was a very good decision; both are very good pals now. Factors: How old is your daughter? If she is below 5 years; make sure she have a toy group; very quiet and playful puppy. If she is bigger may be you can get a bigger one. Because size and attitude of dog will matter Is your daughter asthmatic or ill constantly? Get low shedding or no shedding dogs. Is she ready for responsibilities? Can she clean; groom your pet. If not; you should be ready to do it for her; so that she doesnot feel distant from her pet. Flat? Staying in a flat; then you have to definitely get a quieter dog so that your neighbours dont complaint against you and regarding toilet training you dont have to worry; it will be tough initially but be persistent and you can work it out. Use a crate initially to keep your pet and .....

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.,Q275_R34_C5,Good,Unfortunately the animals sold at Souq Wagif are in miserable condition so you will pay 3 times what you paid for the dog just to get it healthy. I was in search of a Siamese cat and bought a kitten there it took 3 weeks of hourly care and lots of Vet bills to keep the animal alive. Its a shame the govt. does not close it down its a menace to animal lovers. So don't buy the puppy and as stated its too young as well.

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.,Q275_R34_C6,Good,I wouldn't reccoemnt buying any animals from the souq. They are seriously mistreated (you only have to go and see them kept in the cages and sprayed with water to see that) and by buying one of these animals you are only further encouraging the sellers to mistreat animals. As others have said; there are better places to get animals (such as any of the vets who always have animals for adoption either in the centre or advertised on the boards). Finally; please consider if you and your daughter are ready for a dog. I personally; wouldn't have a dog in a my small 2 bed flat. I do; however; have a cat. Dogs must be walked every day (even in the heat of summer);. What will you do if you go on annual leave? Dogs are more expensive to be looked after than cats because they need more attention. Are you ready to pay high vet bills if your pet gets sick and can you afford the right amount of food every day? If you are confident that you are ready for a dog; then I wish you and your daughter the b.....

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.,Q275_R34_C8,PotentiallyUseful,PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY DOGS OR CATS FROM ANY SOUQS OR PET SHOPS! A 4 week old puppy should still be with it's mother. The chances are that if you take it home; you will get attached to it and then it will die. It's too young to be away from it's mum; it's too young to be vaccinated; it won't have had proper puppy formula or health treatments. Please save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from dogs and puppies in the souqs. They are normally sick; not vaccinated or too young. Some have diseases that can be passed to humans and you never know if the dog maybe belongs to somebody already and it has been stolen/found and sold to the pet shops. If you seriously want a dog and are ready for the committment for the next 15 years; please contact one of the animal rescue groups or adopt a pet from a family. And make sure that whatever animal you get - it must have been vaccinated and neutered.

I would really love to get a small puppy dog for my kids..but i am worried about the kind of lifestyle we would have..like are we allowed to bring dogs to the mall? or are there very restricted areas for dogs? I would want to bring my small dog to places if possible. Any advice would be appreciated.,Q275_R48_C7,Bad,No I do not have a dog; but used to have dogs in the past. Had 1 dog for 16 years and he travelled everywhere with me. Now I am a muslim and in islam one should not have a dog inside the house & to have a dog here in this weather & only keep him outside is unfair to the dog. So now I have cats. Aisha-Taweela

The shelter is currently full and can not take any more stray dogs; so if you adopt from there you are freeing up space for another stray to be taken in.

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.

This is an all in pay i.e I would have to take care of my housing also Also what is the cost of car rental / Loan in Qatar ?,Q276_R11_C10,PotentiallyUseful,I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.

The fine for having a child in your lap in the front seat is the same as talking on a hand-held cell phone! I've asked our pediatrician why there hasn't been an all out education campaign but no one knows. 25-year-behind syndrome I guess. Carseats are available though.
851,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C2,Good,You get a good selection of car seats here. Try Toys 'R Us; Babyshop or Mothercare.
852,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C3,Good,I highly suggest putting your young ones in a car seat! Have you seen the driving? Not to mention the amount of accidents that happen everyday! Children are our most precious gifts; and we need to protect and keep them safe! I have seen good ones at Toys R Us! Good Luck! Also try consumer reports for the newest and greatest!
853,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C4,Good,Never heard about car seat law ... but i still recommend you putting your little on into car seat for their safety; not for fear of the law. Plenty of choice ... most shops like baby shop are toys r us sell them.
854,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C5,Good,I bought my sons Graco car seat at Toys R Us...they have several brands to choose from. As far as carseats go; I sent a letter to the Sheikha. I think there needs to be a law that to leave the hospital when you have a baby; you must have a car seat. It should be checked by the hospital.
855,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C6,PotentiallyUseful,We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?

857,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C8,Bad,Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.
858,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C9,PotentiallyUseful,Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant; I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule. I totally s.....
859,Q276_R26,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q276_R26_C10,Bad,I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.
860,Q276_R27,Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly. I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?,Q276_R27_C1,Good,Insurance is between 3% and 4% a year...and seriously; while the driving keeps you on your toes...it isn't THAT bad!

I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz

Car insurance not really that bad. In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car. So anyone can drive the car and still insured. If you know what i mean. We pay around 2000 QR for our cars. Again our car are not a posh car. :-)

I think you will find that the car is covered for accidents but not people in the car. You may need to take out seperate insurance for the passengers. Fully comprehensive in Qatar is not the same as fully comprehensive in the UK
868,Q276_R27,Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly. I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?,Q276_R27_C9,Good,Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.

I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?,Q276_R27_C10,Good,When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.

But in the end; it's just a stupid rationalization for not doing what would keep your children safe. Especially in light of recent stats on road injuries per capita in Qatar (""""Qatar suffered four times more injuries in road accidents per 100;000 people than the second-placed country; Kuwait; and tied with South Africa for the most road deaths; the report shows.""""); you'd think they might want to start enforcing the laws on the books. I feel sorry for the kids who have these people as parents. But I guess it's just Social Darwinism in action.

It's dangerous for your child to be out of a car seat; front or back.
920,Q277_R7,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q277_R7_C1,PotentiallyUseful,The carseat law here is a joke. The fine for having a child in your lap in the front seat is the same as talking on a hand-held cell phone! I've asked our pediatrician why there hasn't been an all out education campaign but no one knows. 25-year-behind syndrome I guess. Carseats are available though.

Not to mention the amount of accidents that happen everyday! Children are our most precious gifts; and we need to protect and keep them safe! I have seen good ones at Toys R Us! Good Luck! Also try consumer reports for the newest and greatest!

Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q277_R7_C4,Good,Never heard about car seat law ... but i still recommend you putting your little on into car seat for their safety; not for fear of the law.

As far as carseats go; I sent a letter to the Sheikha. I think there needs to be a law that to leave the hospital when you have a baby; you must have a car seat. It should be checked by the hospital.
925,Q277_R7,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q277_R7_C6,PotentiallyUseful,We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?

927,Q277_R7,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q277_R7_C8,Bad,Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.
928,Q277_R7,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q277_R7_C9,PotentiallyUseful,Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant; I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule. I totally s.....
929,Q277_R7,Is there a carseat law in Qatar. Is there a selection of carseats to buy in Doha?,Q277_R7_C10,Bad,I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.

There's no law to where children need to be strapped into child safety seats. There's no awareness. There's ignorance. The sight of a baby riding in dad's lap as dad is driving is quite common. Quite horrific.

Here's what I found: Baby items (nursing/feeding): Chicco; Avent; Munchkin; Gerber; etc. car seats/Strollers: MacLaren; Pliko; Chicco; Graco Jarred food: Gerber; limited selection of Heinz organic; hero Formula: Similac; Nan (by Nestle) Diapers: Pampers and Huggies and Luv??

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....

One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....

Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.

If your husband likes a drink he could try Garveys or the Rugby club. Alot of british use these. I believe you have to join as a member or come with someone as a guest. Tell him to buy a copy of the Marhaba in Carrefours supermarket in City Centre. that lists all events happening in Q and where to go. It is updated every season. It is also available at Jarirs bookstore. What co. does your husband work for?

Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old; he is used to playing out on his bike etc... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!

1010,Q278_R14,Hi everybody As everybody know; that beach is just a big dump of trash. Why we don't organize some kind off group that could take care; clean and protect the beach.

Do anybody know where to start; and do we need authorization from the Government to take some action; like grade and clean the beach? Some money will be needed; if there is a start point I can participate with 1000 rials. Maybe it seams like a crazy idea; but Qatar deserve it; not just come here and take the money,Q278_R14_C2,PotentiallyUseful,There WAS a ton of garbage in the spring; but not sure how clean it is now. Canadian School organized an environment day to clean-up the beach in May 07. With 10 children and three adults; we managed to collect a dozen garbage bags full of stuff including and old tire; carpet; load of glass bottles; tons of bottle caps; etc. etc.

Maybe it seams like a crazy idea; but Qatar deserve it; not just come here and take the money,Q278_R14_C4,PotentiallyUseful,I go there almost every weekend; cause I plan to do some Kite There are broken glasses; bottles; tires; carpets; plastic bags everywhere; month of May is long gone. I think renting a heavy machine to grade; and remove all the trash; was a morning job; and everybody will profit it. Is unbelievable; the amount of broken plastic chairs; and stuff you can find there. I think the beach deserve our respect and protection; I'm not criticizing; but the damage is done; and action and not words need to be taken; every time I go there I bring my trash; and some times pick some plastic bottles around. Now there is a big dump of sand; maybe for construction. In a Country almost like an Island; not having a proper beach to go; is a shame. I can use Hotels; but to be honest for example the beach of the Resort in Messaid is worst; not only the trash but boats and jet skis like fly's. Check mate.....

I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking. I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution. Please don't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones. When I start to see convoys of Qataris taking pride in and cleaning up their own country (and not paying Sri Lankans a pittance to do it for them); I'll gladly stop and lend a hand. -- Since Allah has given me a brain; it would seem like a sin not to use it.

Good to know people like rassadko feel that we should do something for this place; but its not going to change with just some cleaning up process once in a way; we need to have people patrol the place and fine them on the spot whenever they are seen littering.Unless; some strict measures which apply both to the locals and residents apply; this country will not improve.

These guys never have a dull moment; doing constructions everywhere and damaging more than constructing. Wait for another 2 years and there would be no need to clean the beach; the cleaning staff would do the rest and you had to pay to visit the beach :( Do not dwell in the past; do not dream of the future; concentrate the mind on the present moment.

There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan. Beware of Channa Fish! They are very dangerous; especially during the onset of winter. They generally don't attack humans; but if they are hungry they may eat humans! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and doesn't want to hunt; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey(the human bathers). If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic! Have a nice swim at Dukhan! Cya.

Thanks!,Q278_R37_C10,PotentiallyUseful,On our foreign ministry's site I read that it is absolutely forbidden to bring Rottweilers; Dobermann and Boxer dogs.

I mean a Pit bull would be more dangerous then those three races. (Yes I know; any dog can be dangerous in the wrong hands; even a Yorkshire; though there would be little reason to fear him.). Where would you buy dogs in Qatar? I mean; if I'd have to leave Kelly at home; I'd love to have some dog around to keep me company if there is no woman who'd volunteer for the job... *gg* Rene -------------------- think different.

The car itself is good but I'm not sure if it would have good resale value here. But if resale isn't an issue; and you like the car; then go for it by all means. you can search for 'dacia duster fifth gear' on youtube if you'd like to see the review yourself. best of luck:-)

If yes then please share the experience about that; i mean about the performance & maintenance cost.,Q279_R28_C5,PotentiallyUseful,well i don't have any idea about renault costs; but what i can tell you with full belief and accuracy is that NOTHING comes close to the reliability and low maintenance costs of japanese cars; especially toyota. they just keep going on and on and on. and if you stick to the basic recommended maintenance schedule; toyotas could run forever haha..i saw a toyota camry few days back which had been driven 798000 kms..that is absolutely and unbelievably high mileage..and the car was ten years old..i could not believe how smooth and quiet it was..all the owner did was take good care of the engine and change oil regularly because he drove a lot..if maintenance and cost and reliability is a concern for you; then japanese cars are the way to go. best of luck:-)

If yes then please share the experience about that; i mean about the performance & maintenance cost.,Q279_R28_C6,Good,Peace be upon you; and how do you do?. First of all; when you live in any Arabian Gulf countries; and thinking to buy a car; then it is better to buy a Japanese car as first choice. However; if you are still new in here and just started working and wants to invest your money in a car; then buy a small Japanese Sedan/Saloon car; as it could save you a lot of money more than any other european cars; specailly here in the Arabian Gulf; as there is not much of experienced good workshops to make maintinane and fix your european car in the future. SO either you go to Mitsubishi cars or Toyota; but Nissan is the last choice as I heared that their workshop is very busy and costing more money; so do Renault which could cost you much more than Nissan. Nevertheless; no one is going to push you away from the car that you would love to buy; but as an advice from a person who has been living in Qatar for 35 years and had and experince with many types of cars; then it is better for you to think more .....

I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a  while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week.  Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it doesn't take much to kill them.  I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now. There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant.

1255,Q280_R41,Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks,Q280_R41_C6,Good,Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....
1256,Q280_R41,Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks,Q280_R41_C7,Good,"""Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that """"stick together"""". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."""
1257,Q280_R41,Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks,Q280_R41_C8,Good,Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to Heart and to continue the Inhaling and Exhaling Proccess. They are responsible of Healing any kind of cut ; they stop the blood flow and they are also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attacks. IF you smoke Hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it goes because Necotine get stuck on the hemoglobin and reduce its functions so the hemoglobin wont be holding much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smokes breathes more than natural people when they do any activity . There body needs Oxygen but the hemo. aint functioning in the way they have to .

There is a clear public health and environmental protection argument for providing guidance on production of desalinated water for drinking-water. There are certain chemicals and microbes that are of particular importance in desalinated water. Of these; particular concern has been expressed regarding the presence of microbes due to blending of final waters that; because they were derived from coastal and marine sources; may not be adequately addressed. Similar concerns have been noted about particular chemicals in source water or that are not well removed by the desalination process.

Need to change filter every six months. Water from tap is good to drink but due to pipeline and untidy water tanks in your apartment you might need to buy & install a Panasonic water purifier which i think is more enough to purify/fitler your tap water and start use that for drinking purposes. I have the two in my house; where I came in without knowing about Panasonic being installed as part of furnished stuff. It's better you avoid drinking botttled water; they are meant for immediate needs. Good Luck! I have an article about this; let me know your e-mail ID; so to e-mail you that stuff.

Non-drinking water could be a mix of RO; distilled and recycled waste water. In this there could be chances of chemicals ( in very low concentations) which are meant to act as lubricants and anti-corrosion agents during reverse osmosis since these additives are not removed fully by the semi-permeable membrane. I don't know if consumption of these chemicals could be detrimental to health in the long run. Expert opinion is required.

I have yet to see it as a joyous occassion... I have been to a few in the last few months; and have been very disappointed.  The ladies seem to be competing with each other in the dress department; and so some outfits are very outlandish... There seems to be so much politics amongs the different groups of ladies sitting at the tables; you know.. this group doesn't like that group; or this part of the family feel snubbed for some reason.... The bride ALWAYS looks terrified and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make- up on her face.  I really feel sorry for her.  One of the brides I saw; took about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of us as I don't think she could move with the dress she was wearing....   And you are right about the mobile thing...

Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment.

Of which I would Rate Air India above QA & GA. In fact the most comfortable was Jet Airways (previously it was National carrier now its gone International and has flights from Doha-India-Doha). I would have to say Jet was the best with Leather Seats; nice leg space; good service et all...(Jet's service is legendary in India) In QA & GA both; my knees were continously touching the front seat & was very uncomfortable. It felt almost as if I was travelling in a Bus...lol Sevice wise I guess all were as good (QA with Filipino staff were good too); But the comfort of the Seat and the Leg space would be the most prized by me.

One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....

On the other hand; your daughter is only three and from my experience (as a nursery teacher) at this age you should foucus on language development (not sure how many languages you teach to your child; but it gets more difficult if you are exponsing your child to two or three different languages); abc's and letter recognicion including reading small words and recongnising her own name in writting; counting and number recognition; colours;shapes arts and crafts and pencil control for tracing lines; numbers and letters.

I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us. My husband's company has offered to pay for their tuition to a private school in Doha; but we are opting to continue homeschooling because it has been such a positive thing.

Or do families go back to their home countries until they can get a place. Any feedback on this will be appreciated.,Q282_R12_C1,Good,I don't know if this is a very popular option. There is a tutoring place here called Cedars and I think some people use this while they are waiting for school places. Tel 468 8192 email cedarstutoring@hotmail.com Getting school places is a problem in Doha but if you have a British passport; you have a better chance than some because you will be given priority in the British curriculum schools. I'm sure you've probably researched which ones are popular here - any that come under the umbrella of BSME (British Schools of the Middle East) and are not-for-profit are generally sound - They have a website www.bsme.org.uk Obviously the best option would be to come over to Doha on a 'look see' visit so that you can check out the schools yourself. In any event; if you are looking for places to start September 2007; you need to act now as it may take 3 - 6 months to go through the process of applying/entrance tests for secondary children etc If have children at secondary and primary level I would.....

Would the kids fit back into the UK system if they were to go back to UK? (sometime; lol) Any other comments appreciated. Thanks.,Q282_R14_C4,Good,A number of my tuition students are from Parkhouse. There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject. Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) is limited. You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that don't. Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum. Finally; Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum; which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government. This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school. You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College; DESS; Sherborne and the International School of London. Good luck.

Thanks.,Q282_R14_C5,Good,Joe90 Not sure how qualified you are to comment on the status of the teachers at Park House school. ALL their teacher comply with SEC conditions on qualifications of their teachers; otherwise they would not be able to operate! I can confirm the vast majority of teachers at the school are British; 2nd is South African (excellent standard of educated teachers) and other nationalities. The school is as british as it gets in a non-british country. The standards are extremely high. There is very positive school/parent contact and all pupils are expected to work hard; are well disciplined; and result focused. I am british and my children attend Park House. I would have no problem with them returning to the UK (not likely with the current working conditions in the UK!) and slipping into very good schools and coping with the change. If you are typical middle class parents who discipline your children and make sure they stay on top of their studies you will reap the benefit of this school which.....

Thanks.,Q282_R14_C6,Bad,As a user of the Qatari and British education systems for my children let me tell you that if you have a good teacher; your child and you are lucky! Usually here about 1 in 5 teachers have that power to inspire YOUR child! Be glad when you get one; no matter what school they are paid by! Education is about inspiring children to progress; not about checking off what they have studied!

Thanks.,Q282_R14_C7,Good,Craftyqueen; let me tell you that all the children who are not as good in reading as the rest of their colleagues are taken away from their normal classes; given to a volunteer parent (who is given a bunch of flashcards with no further instructions) who is supposed to help them develop reading skills. Not only is that wrong; but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class. And don't try and tell me it's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1. Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House. The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking! Waiting hours for nothing? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem!

Thanks.,Q282_R14_C8,Good,Alumnar I am surprised you are willing to say negative comments about the school your children attend on QL. Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place. In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read. I can't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading. If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion. In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week; their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible. The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week. Parents are asked to participate in their child's learning by listening to their child read at home. Schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere. As for fairness - the World is not fair and.....

Thanks.,Q282_R14_C9,Good,"""Some of the comments that have been made on this thread are more than a little misleading. For example; are we comparing Parkhouse (or any other school in Doha) with fee-paying; independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school; I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison. One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are """"extremely high"""". Well; if there is an acute shortage of school places; then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates. I have not heard much about Parkhouse's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their """"extremely high standards"""". That also might explain Parkhouse's preference for nice; white English children. Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC; the Supreme Council of Education. This is a ....."""

Thanks; Roland,Q282_R17_C3,Good,QIS is a good school and has excellent results. The pastoral side is too very good; with caring staff. Qatar Academy maybe the school where money is no object but the academic standards are not as impressive; especially in Primary. Doha College is a good school but fees are high; Primary section ws a school that merged with the existing Doha College - secondary school. DESS is also a British school here - mainly British kids. Noticed you are from the Netherlands; there is a Shell School in Doha that has the Dutch curriculum incorporated into it. Hope that this all helps; warning there is a huge demand for schools in Doha as the expat population is increasing more quickly than new schools can be set up - so get your children down an a waiting list ASAP.

1455,Q282_R17,Hello; Me and my family are thinking of re-locating to Doha. Does anyone know anything about the Qatar International School ? Or any other British schools there. Thanks; Roland,Q282_R17_C6,Good,We relocated our teenagers in August and finally settled for QIS and are very pleased because the school has been extremely helpful and supportive in accepting two non-native speaking kids into year 10 and 12. We can recommend the school to 100%. Our kids came from the liberal Swedish school system but have settled very well. We have visited ALL English-speaking schools in Doha; and the only problem is that they are all full. Waitlisting and constant telephone calls to find out if something is happening is my advice. We spent 6 months before coming to Qatar to find a school; including 2 trips to sit entrance tests. Nerve-wracking - a week before school start we knew they had a place....

Most parents looking for an American education for their children would prefer the faculty to at least have English as their native tongue; not to mention the requisite qualifications and experience Ummhamza; calm down; I'm just putting the information that I have out there for the benefit of the original poster.

Thanks,Q282_R18_C10,Bad,Salam PM.  Yes; I do find it quite disturbing that there are many schools in Qatar with staff with no teaching qualification.  Most schools are profit making so inevitably (sometimes big) corners are cut and it's always the child who loses by being given a sub-standard education.  I'm also very disappointed that the local Independent Schools have teachers teaching English who cannot even speak English properly.  We are letting ourselves down unecessarily.

1470,Q282_R35,Good evening to everybody; we are moving to Doha in April and I am staying at home with our daughter of 17 months. I was wondering if you can tell me how is life with a toddler in such a hot country? Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat. What do you mums do all day to keep them occupied? Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much,Q282_R35_C1,Good,Hi; I have 3 children and they love the outdoors but during the summer months I send them out only after sunset because it's really hot and we have a lot of sand storms or dust storms so then it's either malls or playing indoors at friends homes. There are a few mother and toddler groups that do fun activities so you could join them. July and August are school holidays here so many go on vacations. Ramadan is also around this time so no eating or drinking outside and shops open late too. Best of luck with your move.

You have to be creative to keep them busy since Doha offers very little to keep kids busy (unless you want spend 3-4 hours in a mall each day).

It's only hot for a few months; so plenty of chances to get out and about with out the kids melting. Plenty of classes such as music classes; gymnastics (for toddlers); playgroups and other things. We have found Doha very much geared toward families with children. Whilst we hear our single friends complain about Doha being too boring; people like us can only dream of the days when we could sleep in for two days if we felt like it. Don't worry; Doha is a very family-friendly place with many activities inside and out; for children. Cheers"""

What do you mums do all day to keep them occupied? Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much,Q282_R35_C8,Bad,Hi Papu21; Doha is quite a safe city. When we shifted from UK to Doha; we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families. To answer your question; yes a compound villa should be plenty safe. Crime is very very low in Qatar. We have fire extinguishers & smoke alarms in our rented villa; if you are worried about fires. Re health; we had a good experience with the general children's hospital when our child was sick. Lots of concerned doctors; all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given. Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler. You can go shopping anywhere and anytime the shops are open; on your own or with your child; in tshirts/shortsleeve blouses and jeans/skirt. No need for head/face coverings or your husband by your side. This is quite common for locals and expats here. Re driving; I find that there is hardly any road courtesy; lots of big car.....

This has given us the name of biggest and trustable employees among all the nationalities & are at par of all as per the GCC nationals say so. I'm proud we are Indians.

Kids are very soft and I like them more than you people who look really less matured to pass such comments.

The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....
1499,Q282_R38,Today children returned late from School (DPS -MIS);the reason being a child was found dead in the school bus. From what I heard; the child dozed off in the bus during her morning trip. The driver did not notice and the child was left in the bus. They found her in the afternoon ;it should have been the heat in the bus that killed her. She was just 4 years old. Did anyone hear about this ?,Q282_R38_C10,Bad,How can the Supreme Education Council not see the poor conditions in which this so-called high profile school is run??

(number of years worked) x (last basic salary) date of joined- 2001,Q283_R7_C4,PotentiallyUseful,Actually the payment is 3 weeks for every year worked; not a month. The Labour Law changed in 2004; previously there was a sliding scale whereby you got more payment for every year that you worked (and the payment was based on full salary not just basic). If you get your hands on the old law you could arugue to your employer that the previous law applied up until January 2005 when the current law was enacted. Worth a shot. Tresgandas your calculation would come out to be the total salary paid; not the EOSB amount.

So if you had worked 5 years you'd get 15 weeks bonus. This assumes the company are paying the bonus at the end of service as they're supposed to; not at the end of each year of service.

I have a question my self & it is related here though I already posted it to questions & answers but it seems no one is really visiting that part of QL so... My company got this habit of delaying people from the date of resignation so they obviously knows about the two weeks max limit of Qatar labor code's article 57.

(IS IT COMPANY CAN GIVE THE GRATUITY TOGETHER WITH MONTHLY SALARY IS IT ALLOW BY THE LAW HERE) IF I GO LEGAL ACTION AGAINST COMPANY ANY USE?? PLEASE ADVISE,Q283_R9_C4,Good,every company is liable to give 21 days annual vacation and 21 days indemnity/gratuity minimum upon completion of one year. some companies to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 months. and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labors and junior staff that they dont get their rights. you can approach the Human rights department and the labor department who help the expat in such cases. @ cupid-s_victim: any resignation or termination should serve a months notice except if you are terminated in your probation period (first 6 months usually). Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period; the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps

PLEASE ADVISE,Q283_R9_C9,Good,Gratuity is paid @ 21 days per year which is calculated on your last basic salary. In your case u said that you are working for the last 6 years here in Qatar with a gross salary of QR.5000/month. So let us assume your date of joining is January 01; 2004 and your basic salary is QR.4000. If so; the calculation is as follows: 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2011 = 21x8 = 168 Days So your gratuity is calculated as = 4000x168x12/365 = QR.22;093.15 Apart from this; your employer should provide a ticket to your home country. The notice period up to 5 five years from the date of joining is 1 month and above that; 2 months. In your case the notice period is 2 months. Gratuity/indemnity is settled net of any staff receivables/recoveries.

What do u think..?,Q283_R26_C10,Good,Designer...I dont see why peopleh ave to speak Arabic; TBH; i speak Arabic and English and i find it hard communicating in public in general; because most speak netiher...esp in shops etc; personally i think we should learn to speak tag a long... Actually i find expats are very respectful of Qatari culture; you might get a few that arent but you wil also get a few from Qatari culture that arent respectful; its normal...

1560,Q283_R35,Why is polygamy/bigamy is considered a crime in the west? Crime in what sense? what if the wife agrees?

Why is polygamy/bigamy prohibited; while prostitution and same sex marriage are being legalized? It is said that even in Islamic countries; bigamy is limited; so why is the west so scared about it?,Q283_R35_C1,Good,economic issues (taxes and benefits); but don't know for sure. I think if everyone agrees and they can support themselves; they shouldn't be penalized. But I do think that children are made the unwitting partners in these situations and it can be very; very hard on them. They don't actually get to consent and the choice is made for them. I don't think the West is scared at all about polygamy. They simply don't approve of it in their societies. It's their right; isn't it? Please note: Prostitution is not legalized in the US (except in one strange county in Nevada that I have never understood) nor is same sex marriage; except in a very few cases.

Why is polygamy/bigamy prohibited; while prostitution and same sex marriage are being legalized? It is said that even in Islamic countries; bigamy is limited; so why is the west so scared about it?,Q283_R35_C10,Good,Polygamy is not a crime; you just can not be married to multiple individuals which has become a standard that derived from Judaism/Christian values. As time progressed and the consequences form multiple partners slowly revealed itself; std's HIV and such; we can conclude that this has been the right approach. Unfortunately the popularity of 'couples' clubs; where couples seek another couple for sexual purposes is becoming more and more popular. Prostitution in some countries is legal; some not. As goes for me governments should legalize prostitution and register all that practice; create labor unions and tax them over their income. Why? This cuts the throat of crime; represses human trafficking and serves a purpose in society. The same goes for soft-drugs.

All the bike shops around Bombay Silk Centre (referred to above) don't exist anymore since much of the area (between Mannai roundabout to Souk Wakif) has been demolished and fenced for the upcoming DohaLand; so don't bother. 2. The shop """"Skate Shack"""" on Salwa Road (on your left after the 2nd roundabout when coming from Ramada) is good but has high end bicycles - cheapest one is QR 1700 3. The 2 shops on the corner of TV Roundabout are low end shops - I bought a bicycle from there for QAR 450... obviously nothing fancy but it works for a routine entry-level recreational street/park biker like me 4. Lulu and Carrefour have very little variety don't go 5. Go Sport and Sports Mart again have higher end sports bikes."""

Any comment?,Q285_R25_C3,Good,I've tried Al Million Taxi so far it was a good experience. The taxi was on time; there was a text from them prior to the agreed time and the name of the driver with the plates. The meter was on and the destination was plotted in their metering machine. But yes since the driver was new he was'nt familiar with where I was going so I have to tell the directions. Other than that I have no problem with getting a taxi from them!

Any comment?,Q285_R25_C5,Good,I wanted to talk about this topic anyway. Yesterday I took a Million cab from Lulu to just two signals away(Near Falcon Petrol Station). He did'nt know where mall round about is. He did'nt know how to change lanes. The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window. Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living. Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities... The taxi was new and clean. The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals. I welcome Million Taxi; with all its faults. Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa.

Any comment?,Q285_R25_C8,Good,we had tried this new taxi recently. as mentioned above; they are polite than the old karwa drivers. They show their respect to costumers not like the old karwa taxi drivers which are arrogant and this new million taxi; they are not choosing their costumers! They charged us an extra 4riyals because they had two meters running. one is always 4 riyals and the other one start at 4 riyals. This is way better than the ole Karwa Taxi's! i hope they'll maintain their good image though.

I have passed this to the police; thought that it may be better for me in the long run instead of ripping the ba@$#&%s head off... happy motoring.

1790,Q285_R37,In contemplating a move to Qatar; I was wondering about the availability of English books as this is one of my favorite hobbies.Â  Is there such a thing as a public library; or are English books only available in bookstores; in which case is there a huge mark-up in comparisson to the US or Canada? Thanks!Â ,Q285_R37_C1,Good,No public library; it has yet to get off the ground; and just the one bookshop. If you're a book-lover you'll be disappointed.

Thanks!Â ,Q285_R37_C9,PotentiallyUseful,See Gulf Times page 3; today Thursday 29 June. Basically; the story says there's a fine library here; but Qataris aren't interested; and westerners can't get past the bureaucracy. Sorry; I don't know how to create hyperlinks here but you can get it on the web at http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=94713&version=1&template_id=36&parent_id=16 The library itself is just off Ras Abu Aboud on the R/A with Jabr Bin Mohammed Street. ie; the R/a after Travel Agents R/A (Ric's Country Kitchen and Sana); heading towards Grand Hamad. Maybe I'll check it out and report back.

So it's true that women; not only in HMC are allowed to sponsor their husband!

HGH has a huge number of nurses.
1803,Q286_R1,Can a Hamad Medical Corporation female nurse get FAMILY VISA for her husband in qatar;if she gets more than 10000 QR????????????????OR FEMALES are not allowed to sponsor their husbands under family visa in Qatar?Is that Govt.'s policy and such kind of Rules are there?,Q286_R1_C4,Good,I was not allowed to sponsor my husband on family visa either. Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.
1804,Q286_R1,Can a Hamad Medical Corporation female nurse get FAMILY VISA for her husband in qatar;if she gets more than 10000 QR????????????????OR FEMALES are not allowed to sponsor their husbands under family visa in Qatar?Is that Govt.'s policy and such kind of Rules are there?,Q286_R1_C5,PotentiallyUseful,I think some companies don't allow it because if their husband comes then the wife might get pregnant and expect time off to raise the child.

""""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"""" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."""

1860,Q286_R36,Hi everyone; Very nice to meet you all. :) My wife and I are moving to Doha in about 3 weeks. As I'm going to be working most days; my wife and I are a little concerned about what she'll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day. We were thinking of getting her enrolled at an ESL school (she doesn't speak much English). Besides take courses; what do other non-expat spouses do to keep busy? Thanks everyone. Hope to meet some of you after we arrive!,Q286_R36_C1,Good,Hi! Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.

I don't take our dog off the leash; so it's not a problem for me that the roadway is busy. He really likes that stretch of grass; since the only real greenery he usually sees are desert shrubs :) I sometimes have to keep him on a shorter leash if anyone is out jogging or walking; but it doesn't seem like the area is frequented very much by others most of the times that I've been out there.

Thanks!,Q288_R54_C10,PotentiallyUseful,On our foreign ministry's site I read that it is absolutely forbidden to bring Rottweilers; Dobermann and Boxer dogs. Would be a pity so I'd have to leave my believed Rottweiler Kelly with my parents. Does anybody have a clue why this is so? Because they are considered dangerous? I mean a Pit bull would be more dangerous then those three races. (Yes I know; any dog can be dangerous in the wrong hands; even a Yorkshire; though there would be little reason to fear him.). Where would you buy dogs in Qatar? I mean; if I'd have to leave Kelly at home; I'd love to have some dog around to keep me company if there is no woman who'd volunteer for the job... *gg* Rene -------------------- think different.

The other day my wife was just waiting for me to take the car out from the parking area of our flat( she was standing inside the parking area but she was busy on her mobile ) when a guy in a Honda Civic stopped and asked her to hop in.

Is it comparable? Thanks,Q288_R61_C7,Good,Bibs; your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar. This instance; that happened with your wife; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries. If I am taking a cab in Cairo; where I live; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car. Not necessarily because I am pretty; but because girls are hit on generally speaking. I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years; with family or without; faced the usual hassles. Downsides: Persistent car followers. At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls. In bars some guys impose themselves; but usually there are guards. On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure. On the Cornich (for long walks; jogging and workouts) guys may try to talk to her. But if the girl is serious enough; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something…) Generally men stare; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve.....

Is it comparable? Thanks,Q288_R61_C10,Good,I am more than surprised to see all these comments; living and working in Qatar as a blond woman; I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned. Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange. I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am.....
2100,Q289_R3,Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights? I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good? Any feedback would be welcome thanks!,Q289_R3_C1,Good,If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to. So there you hav it; one recommendation

For clubbing there is only the Pearl (with the awful DJ JoJO) and Cloud Nyn where the crowd is very very young. I guess if you want clubbing you really do have to go to Beirut.

Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house; have dinner (bbq) and drinks (alcohol) you can buy alcohol if you have the license; play some games (e.g. Risk and Card) watch the latest dvd; you can put music on and DANCE (Becareful your neighbor!!!!) and if you too drunk to go home; your friend can get you a lift; or there always a taxi.

2130,Q289_R13,Hey guys have you been to Cube ? I think its cool its just At the back of Ramada Hotel its like a Night Club ! Though i think its hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just found last night while making a detour you know the traffic! While i was driving i see this long line little did i know its a line to get inside this new club...do you think its own by Ramada Hotel? anyway its a good thing they are already permitting building clubs!,Q289_R13_C1,Good,i went tuesday; i thaught it was pretty poor tbh; lots of working women and a bad philipino coversband playing rock ballards of the 80s. the design is interesting; nothing like a propper nightclub; far too bright; no disco lighting; very restrictive about upstairs couples/vip area. it reminded me of nightclubs you see in american movies-pretty synthetic and fake. i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a Bourbon and coke cost the same price as a coke; and everyone from work had rank hangovers despite quitting at 11.30 yes its owned and staffed by ramada.

While i was driving i see this long line little did i know its a line to get inside this new club...do you think its own by Ramada Hotel? anyway its a good thing they are already permitting building clubs!,Q289_R13_C3,Good,I went on Thursday and had a good time with some friends. I thought the band was pretty good; maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though. Everyone that had went before me summed it up as feeling like a warehouse and it's mostly due to the white walls I think. Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium; buncha guys standing around leering at the girls. Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place. The ratio of guys to girls was about the same as everywhere else; 10 guys to 1 girl.

Night life in Qatar hmmmm is there such a thing? From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in. Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs; what makes them good and what makes them bad. Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them; in the case of Doha they will always be bad. Face facts if you got to a nightclub to pick up women (of any culture) then your not in to clubbing!

Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex. Real clubbing....IS.... music; dancing not what has been described on here. This is not just my opinion; there are many clubbing web pages; and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum. Have you ever been to Ibiza? granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing; not about picking up women!

Places like the Buddha Bar would go down a treat here; or something not quite so big as Ministry of Sound; Liquid; Pasha Happy hunting; we all need the entertainment

You are joking arent you I mean no one could be that seedy and be proud of it? Dvargas you didnt enlighten us with your wisdom of clubbing????? Anyone who knows about clubbing knows its not about standards; its about the music; the dancing the adrenaline! Not about pulling some sweaty speck who comes up to you with his checked shirt and fetching gold necklace! Thanks guys for making me giggle!! The cube a club he he he!!!

(maybe a dozen buildings) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available. Personally; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club. Al Farden Tower (where the BMW dealer is located) is very nice; but no balconies if that is important to you. 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors. The residences at the W Hotel are also quite nice; but no balconies.

In her daycare here in Quebec; she was in a French speaking environment; so we have no other option to continue in the French system. The Canadian school in Doha offers only an english program. I hope it works in either Voltaire or Bonaparte. I heard that Voltaire are opening a new school; any news? And how about my 1 yo daughter; where can I put her? Thx
2362,Q291_R35,Hi all; Moving to Qatar soon. What do you recommend as a French school;Lycee Voltaire or Lycee Bonaparte? And why per experience? Thx,Q291_R35_C3,Good,"""Hi; I moved from Montreal to Doha almost 3 years ago . My oldest goes to Bonaparte and am very happy with the school . As for Voltaire they are opening a new campus in Al Waab and the main campus will remain in West Bay As for your one year old ; if you want a french nursey you have Petis Pas and a newly opened one called Perles d""""avenir . There's also a french website than can help you with all the questions you have www.vivreauqatar.com. Bonne chance Tania"""
2363,Q291_R35,Hi all; Moving to Qatar soon. What do you recommend as a French school;Lycee Voltaire or Lycee Bonaparte? And why per experience? Thx,Q291_R35_C4,PotentiallyUseful,Hi Tania; Good news for Voltaire; especially that I may be interested in living in Al Waab; I heard that housing is more affordable there than in West Bay and that it's a pretty nice neighborhood too. I think I'll try for both school; I'm looking for a Grande section (GS)level so hopefully with the new campus opening soon I may be lucky to find a place.
2364,Q291_R35,Hi all; Moving to Qatar soon. What do you recommend as a French school;Lycee Voltaire or Lycee Bonaparte? And why per experience? Thx,Q291_R35_C5,PotentiallyUseful,Just to inform you; even you choice the Voltaire or Bonaparte school; I just know the French nursery named Perles d'avenir; it's new one; but incredible fantastic ! I have my daughter there (26 months old) and she and I really love it ! If you need more details check their website : www.perlesdavenirqatar.com. About Voltaire; i know that they will open a second school; and they are a nice french school. If you are French you will have a big discount on it. I know that they provide a qualified french education and add with that the history/geography and arabic language to be adapted to the qatar. I think that an interesting addition ! Good luck to your choice.
2365,Q291_R35,Hi all; Moving to Qatar soon. What do you recommend as a French school;Lycee Voltaire or Lycee Bonaparte? And why per experience? Thx,Q291_R35_C6,Good,I forgot to precise; bonaparte have a really limited available place in kindergarten; may be they are already full; you have to contact us before; in case of you could do the registration by distance. In other case; as voltaire will open a second school; you will have more chance to have available place. But you have to know that in qatar the registration in school; nursery ... is really difficult because there are too much children for a little number of good school. So do it as soon as possible !!! Good luck
2366,Q291_R35,Hi all; Moving to Qatar soon. What do you recommend as a French school;Lycee Voltaire or Lycee Bonaparte? And why per experience? Thx,Q291_R35_C7,Bad,we are not french but Canadian; and I doubt they give any priorities to French Canadians. What i did is I sent a pre-admission request and I was told to wait until the commission decides. I don't know if this is the standard procedure or just a subtle way to say no? And besides I don't think I have a back-up plan as these are the only French schools in Doha; unless you can refer me to other schools? And my final question; in case nothing french works; do you think is it too late to put my daughter in an English school even though she doesn't speak English (she will be 5 years old at the school entrance)? Thanks

Thx,Q291_R35_C8,PotentiallyUseful,Dono; I'm sure that you couldn't find in bonaparte because they have priority people. But; at 90% I'm sure that you could in voltaire. They have priority to qatari and French; but they open a second big school so they have lot of available places for now ! Try to send them an email; they will answer you ! For any english or other old school; it will really difficult to register your child; you had to do in advance; so inform you immediately; try to call few school and you will have an idea ! How old is your child ? Do he/she need to have an exam to enter in French shcool ? Do he/she speak French fluently ? Good luck

Thx,Q291_R35_C9,Bad,Peter - I already wrote to Voltaire and was told to wait for the decision by the admission commission. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Voltaire as it looks like a nice school. Besides I have no other choice and am scared that my daughter may waste the whole year because of lack of place in school; that would make me thinking twice about the move to Qatar. We'll be there in June and she'll be 5 next august. And she's fluent in french; but doesn't speak English at all...What are my options?
2369,Q291_R35,Hi all; Moving to Qatar soon. What do you recommend as a French school;Lycee Voltaire or Lycee Bonaparte? And why per experience? Thx,Q291_R35_C10,PotentiallyUseful,I'm sure that the commission will be ok; they are well advanced in the process; and they speak to the radio that they will open the school. I'm not afraid by that.But I understood your situation; here the school are to much full; some companies do not accept anymore family because they can not be sure to assure a place at school. Don't worry for you and continue to keep contact with the school. I know that they like parent that insist; keep contact; want always news about the expected registration; ... Like that they will know that you are serious and motivate; so continue your email; your call... Good luck
2370,Q291_R36,Have any expats on this forum either bought property in Qatar; or considered buying and then rejected - i.e zig zag towers; the Pearl etc ? I'm trying to evaluate whether or not this would be a good investment. What do you think are the potential risks and upsides ? If you have bought; what was your experience of the process and in hindsight; was it a good decision ? Regards,Q291_R36_C1,PotentiallyUseful,Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers... I'm absolutly no help am I? lol~ sorry :(

If you have bought; what was your experience of the process and in hindsight; was it a good decision ? Regards,Q291_R36_C2,Good,I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.

If you have bought; what was your experience of the process and in hindsight; was it a good decision ? Regards,Q291_R36_C3,Good,Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....

Regards,Q291_R36_C4,PotentiallyUseful,What is the problem; I would maybe have a few doubts about the Pearl just becasue its reclaimed land but my tower built on solid ground out of concrrete. I think it will be ok for some time to come. The finishing in this country is appauling but you can't argue that the building are not solid.

Regards,Q291_R36_C5,Good,Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.

Regards,Q291_R36_C7,Bad,I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?

Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation.

2400,Q292_R7,Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly.

I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz

Car insurance not really that bad. In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car. So anyone can drive the car and still insured. If you know what i mean.

I think you will find that the car is covered for accidents but not people in the car. You may need to take out seperate insurance for the passengers. Fully comprehensive in Qatar is not the same as fully comprehensive in the UK

As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.

Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.

The charge their credit cards without consent and then refuse to help settle the issue.

2460,Q292_R39,Can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport? Thank you guys...,Q292_R39_C1,PotentiallyUseful,but don't know the process. It is possible.
2461,Q292_R39,Can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport? Thank you guys...,Q292_R39_C2,Good,the RP ID (together with your passport) should be submitted to the Immigration to cancel it. HOWEVER ; THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as absconding/absconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities; they will no longer issue you an NOC letter; and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported. That would be the worst scenario. This happened to someone I know 2 years ago. I'm not sure if the procedure changed.

Thanks; Fitri,Q292_R44_C2,PotentiallyUseful,Hey fitri; We moved here Oct 2004 from Dallas and it took roughly 60 days for our furniture and household goods to arrive. I'm not sure about your second question. As far as I know the shipment made its way to us shortly after it arrived and had cleared customs; so we never stored it. I suppose it would have been nice to send it 2 months in advance of our arrival though.

What are the documents required to send a shipment; what is required to receive a shipment. Any information on household shipments and regulations would be appreciated. Thanks; Fitri,Q292_R44_C4,PotentiallyUseful,I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz

What are the documents required to send a shipment; what is required to receive a shipment. Any information on household shipments and regulations would be appreciated. Thanks; Fitri,Q292_R44_C8,Good,Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.

2480,Q292_R49,hey guys. I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance. Is that a great deal? how about the free accommodation does it look good? I`m anxious about my new job. help pls.,Q292_R49_C1,Good,Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.

Is that a great deal? how about the free accommodation does it look good? I`m anxious about my new job. help pls.,Q292_R49_C3,Good,"""Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse; the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment; nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals; plus one for openning this year; in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor; if you will be assigned in al khor; your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home; not all patients know english.

Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment. Hope this helps.

2553,Q293_R29,hi all ;; what is the The best place can be visited in qatar To enjoy with ur friends ? ur family ? with any one ?,Q293_R29_C4,Good,have a go at the doha zoo; apart form the not so many kind of animals; you have a mini theme park with thrill rides. try al-khor beach; another historical place to be. and the water theme park off salwa road.
2554,Q293_R29,hi all ;; what is the The best place can be visited in qatar To enjoy with ur friends ? ur family ? with any one ?,Q293_R29_C5,Bad,Personally; Qatar is a boring place. There's nothing really enticing place to go here. My advice to you is just stay indoors you'll be safe from rogue teenagers who'll beat you and from stupid drivers who drives like they have a date with Death. Zoo? you have that in your country. Beach? I bet your own country have better beach resorts. Water theme park? I don't think sharing a pool with someone who only takes a bath once in a blue moon is a bad idea. Museum? You'll learn more by surfing the net.

2570,Q293_R51,My family and I are moving to Doha from the U.S. soon. What are some of the activities for teenages; ages 14-17. I have two in that range; and they enjoy sports...mostly tennis and soccer.,Q293_R51_C1,Good,Doha has an overdone of sporting facilities! The Doha Asian Games are next year which means there are a lot of sporting facilities and events happening. Also; there are a number of sport and health clubs that you can join. Soccer is big here and the season is starting soon. Qatar has a number of big names playing in the local league (usually end of career European and South American players who are lurred by the big bucks). The ATP Tennis Tour also visits Doha and entrance to matches are free!

I have two in that range; and they enjoy sports...mostly tennis and soccer.,Q293_R51_C2,Good,I personally think there's lots for a teenager to do here. I think it's mostly like most western countries with the exception of all the bad influences (No alcohol in grocery stores and such). Apart from the sports that have been mentioned a billion times; there are a lot of other ones that anyone may join and most of the time get coaching for free. Golf; archery; shooting and a lot of other ones that are completely free. For the not so sport oriented teen; there's the Scientific Club which is like a club that allows members to expand their scientific abilities. The Scientific Club will die out soon as the new Science and Technology park is opening up soon and lots of major corprations such as Microsoft and Dell are taking part in it. Movies aren't half bad either. The real blockbusters make it here within a week; while other not-so-good ones make it here in 2-3 weeks. There's also Alladin's Kingdom which is an OK theme park. Isn't as great as many others but it's OK. This won't last l.....

Thanks,Q295_R40_C7,Good,If you haven't been to Doha before; you will have to be ready for some adjustments. Since this is a Muslim country; Christmas is celebrated mostly in private. It is not a public holiday. If you are a Catholic; there is a midnight mass here. Just check the schedule. Private dinner party/gathering is how most Christians do it here. There are also some hotel/restaurants that schedule events during the day or the eve. The same goes for New Year. Most locals and other muslims are very tolerant about Christians celebrating Christmas; some even join the New year celebrations. Just be well aware of the limits and keep your respect of the local culture.

2860,Q296_R50,I know it's a ways off; but I would love to hear how people in Qatar celebrate the holiday. I imagine it's more fun here than in the U.S. for example; because Qatar is a Muslim country. Does anyone have special traditions to commemorate the end of Ramadan? I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :),Q296_R50_C1,Good,I remember my Eid childhood. It was great. We'd first meet up at my grandfather's home. We'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding. We'd all go from house to house; sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal. After going door to door; we'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast. Parents would usually chat. Families get together. People visit and they have some tea and snacks. We pray.

Does anyone have special traditions to commemorate the end of Ramadan? I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :),Q296_R50_C4,Good,Oh Oryx; you are so right! Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality). For a lot it is. Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion). We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal. Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year. I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan. This is something to do with us; of course; and also the influx of expats. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...

Does anyone have special traditions to commemorate the end of Ramadan? I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :),Q296_R50_C5,Good,We tend to do a bit of baking prior to Eid. Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid. What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here; so our friends tend to become our new support structure. On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items! LOL I guess that's our variation on spending the day at the park (too hot) or visiting the grandparents (too far) or staying at home (too boring).

2906,Q297_R1,I am using Nissan Altima for past two years. I am planning to settle back India. Is it possible to ship my car to India? Is it advisable. Any one did earlier.,Q297_R1_C7,Good,check india custom deptt website for latest rules; they have mentioned it all. They do allow import of self used vehicles in case you are going permanantly; closing RP. btw; as others say; it's not wise to transfer altima; you can get same kindaa car in same price (used one) considering heavy duty paid at suctom and charges for changing LHD to RHD. However if you have someone known in customs; process may be quite easy.

Thanks; Fitri,Q297_R17_C2,PotentiallyUseful,Hey fitri; We moved here Oct 2004 from Dallas and it took roughly 60 days for our furniture and household goods to arrive. I'm not sure about your second question. As far as I know the shipment made its way to us shortly after it arrived and had cleared customs; so we never stored it. I suppose it would have been nice to send it 2 months in advance of our arrival though.

What are the documents required to send a shipment; what is required to receive a shipment. Any information on household shipments and regulations would be appreciated. Thanks; Fitri,Q297_R17_C4,PotentiallyUseful,I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz

What are the documents required to send a shipment; what is required to receive a shipment. Any information on household shipments and regulations would be appreciated. Thanks; Fitri,Q297_R17_C8,Good,Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.

They follow the crowd... n Also there is blind following of American Brands n Japanese... You sell a toy car labelled """"made in America"""" And the so called Qataries will buy tht in Whole sale.. to boasts About tht fact tht they own American Stuff....

This instance; that happened with your wife; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries. If I am taking a cab in Cairo; where I live; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car. Not necessarily because I am pretty; but because girls are hit on generally speaking. I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years; with family or without; faced the usual hassles. Downsides: Persistent car followers. At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls. In bars some guys impose themselves; but usually there are guards. On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure. On the Cornich (for long walks; jogging and workouts) guys may try to talk to her. But if the girl is serious enough; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something…) Generally men stare; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve.....

Thanks,Q297_R33_C10,Good,I am more than surprised to see all these comments; living and working in Qatar as a blond woman; I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned. Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange. I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am.....

Rgds ASD""",Q297_R39_C4,Bad,Hi Folks; I am starting work in Doha in August and I was wondering if anyone knows if it is possible to transfer my UAE license to a Qatar one? My Canadian license has long since expired; but I have been on my UAE license for the past 5 years. I would rather not deal with the hassle of redoing my Canada license this summer; but I bet it would be simpler than doing the Qatari driving exam! Anyone have any experience with this? Cheers!

Rgds ASD""",Q297_R39_C6,Good,first of all you have to get your residence permit; afterwhich you can apply for a qatar driving license. if you already have a driving license from your country; take note that most of the western countries they will just convert it. no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school. if your license is from asia; it depends; but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test (signal; L and pocket parking; road test) or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two weeks. hope this helps

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more.

If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.

It's really up to her and what she chooses to wear. I guess she believes that in the end she answers to Allah. Some say religious advice on clothing is law; some say guidelines. I think her family/husband have agreed with this choice of outfit; as has the Qatar team she represents. Not a big deal. Remember; she's wearing it in a sporting competition; not down the local souq. In all religions; the followers practise their belief in lots of different ways. For example; here in Qatar one sees Muslimas completely covered in black...face covered; black gloves on; the lot. Then you see other Muslimas in very figure-hugging outfits and lots of make up. It'a personal choice. ______________________________________________________________________ Love is the answer...

3160,Q299_R23,What happened here? Seems to me some of us were having a sensible discussion about prostitution in Qatar and the thread vanished??? Am I missing something? I did not see anything deserving of sensoring/editing unless we look at the original post; and I am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread 'alive'. Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?,Q299_R23_C1,Good,It's not that China; it was deleted because the thread was trolling and promoting prostitution; such threads that promote something whether it was prostitution or otherwise gets deleted. But it wasn't cause of the topic itself so we can continue here :-)
3161,Q299_R23,What happened here? Seems to me some of us were having a sensible discussion about prostitution in Qatar and the thread vanished??? Am I missing something?

Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?,Q299_R23_C2,PotentiallyUseful,that's why it was deleted. I was the one who reported it to Qatari. Nevertheless the thread was becoming interesting. I'm sorry :( May the roof above us never fall in; and may the friends below never fall out!

Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?,Q299_R23_C3,PotentiallyUseful,So let's talk about it here! :-) I'm surprised that prostitution is that open in what is considered a conservative country; I mean if it's so obvious that these women are prostituting them; then I'm sure authorities know about it...the question is...why aren't they doing anything about it ?
3163,Q299_R23,What happened here? Seems to me some of us were having a sensible discussion about prostitution in Qatar and the thread vanished??? Am I missing something?

Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?,Q299_R23_C4,Bad,OK; thats understandable; thank you. It also underlines mir83 and my point that we believed prostitution is less tolerable here in Qatar. However; the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives; until something is said by somebody; and then the routine mass deportations take place. It goes quiet for a while; and then the 'night girls' start building up in numbers again to the level they are now. My last sentence; before the previous thread was deleted was something like this; 'mark my words; the ladies will vanish any day now. Over the few weeks after that; their numbers will slowly increase again; and the cycle repeats it's self'. Obviously somebody is behind this (a pimp); as a sponsor for these girls.

Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?,Q299_R23_C5,Bad,If someone is actually behind this (which I believe so); it has to be someone in a high position; someone who has control over authorities...what other explanation is there for the lack of action by the authorities ?

Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?,Q299_R23_C6,Bad,Cornellian; somebody answered this on the previous thread just before it was deleted. I cannot recall the poster; but it was suggested that some body in authority; possible with some 'wasta' to throw around; was probably behind it. My apologies if I have not recalled what was said precisely; but I would go along with that theory anyway. There are just far too many girls; far too often; in so many places for it to be anything else. Unless somebody knows differently ofcourse ................?

Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?,Q299_R23_C7,Bad,looks like we are on the same wave length here. I would guess that the authorities are 'bending' to a certain extent under the threat of this 'person's' wasta. The final breaking point is probably reached when the religious fraternity start to object/speak out.

I think no matter what anyone says or does; prostitution will always exist everywhere; because there will always be women who need the money and men who are ready to pay."""

3170,Q299_R37,Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights? I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good? Any feedback would be welcome thanks!,Q299_R37_C1,Good,If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to. So there you hav it; one recommendation

Any feedback would be welcome thanks!,Q299_R37_C3,Good,Is pretty good on a Thursday night. Nice crowd of people and a good British band. Not clubbing though. For clubbing there is only the Pearl (with the awful DJ JoJO) and Cloud Nyn where the crowd is very very young. I guess if you want clubbing you really do have to go to Beirut.

Any feedback would be welcome thanks!,Q299_R37_C5,Good,I agree with Tyler and bbksiu. Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house; have dinner (bbq) and drinks (alcohol) you can buy alcohol if you have the license; play some games (e.g. Risk and Card) watch the latest dvd; you can put music on and DANCE (Becareful your neighbor!!!!) and if you too drunk to go home; your friend can get you a lift; or there always a taxi. So you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving.

They both serve alcohol; have music (live/djs) but that's where the comparison ends. """"Where would you go for RnB and hiphop?"""" Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore.

Im only interested in the diseases that will make me fail the exam. And how many days or weeks will the result will be available? Thanks,Q300_R54_C4,PotentiallyUseful,Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks.

3274,Q300_R54,Hi all. I finished my medical exam here in Doha. I would like to know besides HIV and TB; is there any other disease checked in the medical examination? Im only interested in the diseases that will make me fail the exam. And how many days or weeks will the result will be available? Thanks,Q300_R54_C5,Good,Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!

Of course he should learn about Islam; but not as something he needs to submit to; but something he should have knowledge about. The same goes for Sharia law. We do indeed live in an Islamic country; so it is important to be familiar with Islam. I like that Arabic is taught; the more languages a person knows;the better. The only problem I have is that so far all the Arabic teachers we encountered are totally useless.

What I mean by this; when explaining to children the various nuances of religious beliefs one has to show a comparative and what that comparative means to that particular religion. If we are going to go down the route of teaching religion in this country we are going to have teach ALL religions; in order to get the history; culture and meanings of what each religion means to that particular one and how in some cases some religions are tied to each other through geographical circumstances and culture and how indeed they came to be that Religion. There will have to be healthy debate and in some cases at High School level; debate as in e.g. Islam and Christianity. Would that work? I think in ex-pat schools it may but in some local private schools; I doubt it. However; if by religious education they mean telling a few stories from Koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion; it could work......

Sharia? I'd personally have a problem with that being mandatory. Because Sharia is a code of law based upon a specific religion; it would only be acceptable to me if it were taught as an elective comparative law class; say; for high school students. Then it would be appropriate. If instead of Sharia; you meant they should be teaching all children Islamiyat/Islamic Studies classes; then you'd get a vehement NO from me. Unless you're going to couch it in a """"comparative religion"""" class that EVERYONE has to take; then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that I don't subscribe to?

Is it valid in case i'm stopped by the Qatar police? Hope to hear comments from you guys. Advance TQ.,Q302_R13_C2,Good,If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin; you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However; if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE; THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license; however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department; where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist; for a small fee). If you have entered the country on a business visa; your sponsor wi.....

Screw the car rentals; you think they know anything? I went to Traffic department and asked. #1 - Not all international licenses are valid. Only ones from certain countries and they have to come with a booklet that contains a card. #2 - No matter what your status is; It is allowed to drive on it for 2 weeks from the time you enter the city. After 2 weeks if you get into an accident; it is your fault no matter what. Car rentals don't tell you these things because you are buying their insurance anyways! #3 - International License means nothing without your original license from back home. When you want to make the Qatar License; you NEED your original license from back home and it has to be recognized so that you don't go through the driving tests in here.

You have to undergo a driving class; then a test; then you get the license. To start a class; you will have to wait for days. UAE wants to reduce the motors on the road; so they will do whatever they can to get this achievement

3479,Q302_R58,Hi to everyone Just to correct Is Qatar DL convertible to UAE DL? Or we have to give some test there?My friend wants to shift to Dubai on residence permit,Q302_R58_C10,Good,Among GCC states; it is understood that; anyone with a GCC driver's license can temporarily drive in any other GCC states but if the individual will have permanent residence then he has to secure a local DL. securing the local DL is the culprit in a lot of confusions. I have a UAE (abu dhabi) DL gotten on Dec. 1993 and expiring this Dec 2008. when i moved here in qatar on Dec 2004; i used my uae driver's license when i was still on a business visa. After i got Qatar RP;I applied for a Qatar DL at the Traffic Department. I submitted my original UAE DL for inspection and then they required me to have an eye test only. After passing the eye test; i was issued a Qatar DL In some GCC states; I hear this is not the case; for example; here in Qatar I hear that they do not recognize Saudi DL? Some GCC states requires DL applicants (even with applicant with GCC DL from another state) to undergo driving schooling;driving test to secure the local DL.

3482,Q302_R74,I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?,Q302_R74_C3,Good,NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries...

3485,Q302_R74,I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?,Q302_R74_C6,Bad,"""I totally disagree with """"Sun Fun Sea"""" all the major accidents are not caused by Indians; may be Indians invloved in this accident because of the other party (most of them are locals with crazy driving) and you can see majority in Qatar are Indians that is why you can see more Indians involved in accidents; but not all their faults; and all Indians are not riding bicycles in their past that is because of your lack of knowledge about India. What was the vehicle you used in your country before invent cars? be logic and dont generalize people with your lack of general knowledge."""

Anyway it's not good to generalise and make such uncalled for statements; especially by an elder like you.

In my own home; they provide security. There are steps to take in the Muslim faith so that dogs are allowed (concerns washing dishes; the person if touched; etc.) My main concern is that this has been allowed to be interpreted as dogs are """"haram"""" - and some people take this as a reason to be cruel and abusive. One (western) person I know said that this was due to """"Arab cruelty"""" (his words; not mine); I in turn replied """"I feel sorry for those who think lke that (and you) because some people (and not just those of the Muslim faith) do not know how much security and real affection dogs can give - they are always happy to see you no matter your state of mind or emotions.

Come down to the rescue shelter when you get here and you'll see the number of pure-bred dogs that were abandoned because they got too big; or too energetic; or because their owner was going on vacation!

Why do you want a labrador? Have you had experience with this breed before? Labradors are far from easy to keep and need a huge amount of exercise so they don't get destructive. Have you had dogs before? Where will it live? Have you thought about what you will do when you go on vacation? Or leave Qatar for good? Have you looked into all the costs involved with having a dog - from adoption fees; vaccinations; food; boarding kennels etc.

3541,Q303_R35,Can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport? Thank you guys...,Q303_R35_C2,Good,the RP ID (together with your passport) should be submitted to the Immigration to cancel it. HOWEVER ; THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as absconding/absconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities; they will no longer issue you an NOC letter; and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported. That would be the worst scenario. This happened to someone I know 2 years ago. I'm not sure if the procedure changed.

3670,Q304_R26,i am a chinese girl now working in shanghai for an American website:www.smarter.com i just graduated from university majoring in english;working in different country is my dream;can someone give me advice what job i can do in Doha;and is it hard to live in the city? are there some good websites for applying a job in Doha? thank you for your time!!,Q304_R26_C1,Good,I would advise you to pick a different place. Many people will view you as nothing but a prostitute in Qatar. Yes Doha is a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month. Plus they aren't going to pay you what you're worth because you are Chinese. Chinese are put into the lower-income bracket in Qatar - that is just the way it is over here. Not fair; I know. If you do go...don't let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself working at the Oasis just so you can buy back your freedom. I hope this helps. Sage

Qatar is the definition of an empty shell. Nothing of substance here whatsoever. Here you have an entire displaced foreign population - all here for working only! There is no culture here. Work is the culture. As for the geography...the worst found anywhere in the world. No trees; no rivers; no lakes; no mountains; lots of traffic though; terrible climate; etc. etc. Combine that with no fun at all; unfair pay based on your nationality; and the surrender of your passport. If that is your idea of enriching your life... go for it!

Salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality. Qatar taxes income by housing rent (50% mininum) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent (even if it increases). You will need QR 1000 for food & other expenses if single. Anything above that you can save; depending on how much you want to save. I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent; else you would be really wasting your time and youth. Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries.(SriLankans & Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low.) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction. 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into. The second is not a boom its a BLAST. Theres always jobs in Construction Companies. All other services are growing.....

It is not easy to make the connections; you have to make the effort but like many other things in life; the more effort you make; the better the rewards.

3710,Q305_R11,This is a question to the likes of PM and others who converted to Islam. Basically; what is involved ? How does a person start the process ? Just intrested....,Q305_R11_C1,Good,My start was that I went to the department of Islamic Affairs and got a bunch of books including the Quran. I started reading at 11am and did not stop until 11pm. I immediately knew that this was the religion for me; eventhough I was highly sceptical when I started reading.... I have read so much since; learned by talking to other Moslims; taken some courses; but my thing is reading so I did that the most. I suggest you talk to some other new moslims. It will be easier as the questions you have are the same questions they had. When I started there were not many people I could approach; nor where there any centres as such and I talked with moslims by birth and they had a hard time understanding my questions. Ofcourse if I can help; let me know! Aisha-Taweela

It is a question of a total change in lifestyle (in my case at least) It has more to do with your innerself. How you look; approach and accept what is in your life. I can tell you it did better than going to a phychoanalist. You learn so much about your self; about the purpose of you being there; about the purpose of living; about the purpose of hardship. Islam should not be hard on you. But it is how hard you make it on yourself. Aisha-Taweela

Then logically; the universe is supposed to come back to its original state at some point of time..who knows. I have tried but could never understand 'quantum Fluctuations' which is said to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity. Further; the 'anti-matter' and 'negetive energies' are still theoretical concepts. If the same are proven someday; it would further help us to understand if the universe will die at all. But; at present; it is a general opinion that universe will keep on expanding and may freeze out when all stars would become either black holes; neutron stars or white dwarfs.

As time progressed and the consequences form multiple partners slowly revealed itself; std's HIV and such; we can conclude that this has been the right approach. Unfortunately the popularity of 'couples' clubs; where couples seek another couple for sexual purposes is becoming more and more popular. Prostitution in some countries is legal; some not. As goes for me governments should legalize prostitution and register all that practice; create labor unions and tax them over their income. Why? This cuts the throat of crime; represses human trafficking and serves a purpose in society. The same goes for soft-drugs.

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..,Q306_R20_C1,Good,You must have two years of work experience to apply for the license. You can work for another year and carry on with it.

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..,Q306_R20_C5,PotentiallyUseful,Another advise; don't take the ILS exam unless you already have a nurse license from NHA because it is useless.

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..,Q306_R20_C8,Good,I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..,Q306_R20_C10,Good,you can take Prometric exam without experience. My exam's validity is 3 yrs... There are many nurses out there are working without license.

I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance. Is that a great deal? how about the free accommodation does it look good? I`m anxious about my new job. help pls.,Q306_R47_C1,Good,Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.

Thanks,Q306_R54_C5,Good,Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!

I got a call from unistaff that my visa is already with them. I went for my medical last Sept. 20; 2012. They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....

3940,Q307_R12,Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful. Any advice out there?,Q307_R12_C1,Good,It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.

Any advice out there?,Q307_R12_C3,Good,I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Any advice out there?,Q307_R12_C4,Good,Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.

Any advice out there?,Q307_R12_C5,Good,Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand

(LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Here I actually mean women from China; Phillipines and Thailand..Easy prey for western men..In other countries South Asia and Middle east women are not availabl.....

At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut.

We always want what we don't have... and the very fact that the Western Men are used to seeing the same type of women all around them; makes them want something they don't have; i.e. the small petite asian women... besides; most of the western men have been thru a marriage earlier and then have asian women... reason being-because they are more homely and like being 'stay home moms' rather than pursuing a career in the West. As far as the Asian Women are concerned; yeh the thought of a better; cleaner and quality life; attracts them more towards the western men... I'm talking general over here... to prove my point; try taking a peep at one of the Cyber Cafe's in Manila or Cebu and you'll see all of them women on webcams talking to a wester man hoping something will click. The same is the case for Asian men... most of them would love to have a Western Woman; but having to work their way to get to that and maybe the thought of failing; makes them wanna .....

Both men have now been charged. The pair were among 15 people who were arrested in Fife as part of a clampdown on drink driving. Fife Police said the pair of superheroes were stopped near Anstruther in the early hours of Sunday morning. The two men; both in their early 20s; were on their way home from a fancy-dress party when they were ordered to pull over.

Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.

""""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"""" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."""

4209,Q310_R14,Hello Friends; I am planning to buy a used car. I do not have experience as what to check before buying a car. Can you please advise what things I am supposed to check before buying the car and how to make sure the engine condition? Thank you very much for your advise.,Q310_R14_C10,Good,Lots of things to check in buying used car; better bring a trusted mechanic with you; under carriage noise is easier to resolve than unusual engine noise so becareful; if you want to check combustion efficiency of a car; check the tail pipe; it must have no oil; and in the morning when you start up the engine for the 1st time; if water condenses out of the tailpipe they say this is a good sign as to engine combustion; i'm sure there are lot of other things you should check; so research as well...

Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.

If you go for a new one and maintain it well; the car should not give you problems for a couple of years.

Thank you,Q310_R35_C4,Good,you can't go wrong with either car; however; the Camry is bigger. You will get good resale for any Toyota. And an older Camry is nothing to worry about; a 2009 Camry is pretty much just starting it's life..4 years is nothing for a Toyota engine and there are Camrys with 800000kms still running around happily with no problems..You'll probably die long before your Camry does haha

My budget is arrount 45K And what I found in market is either : Camry 2009 or Corolla 2012 So what do you think ? Thank you,Q310_R35_C5,PotentiallyUseful,just make sure that whatever car you decide to buy; has a full service record and stay away from cars with unknown histories..a car is only as good as its maintenance and even a Camry/Corolla has to depend on its owner to take care of it. You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr. they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car.. Best of luck

So; I've seen the car I want in Dubai. Is it possible for me to get a loan here; buy the car from Dubai; import and then register it here; or will the bank not allow it as the car isn't in country? Thanks,Q310_R52_C1,Good,take a personal loan for the amount needed for the car... You can then have the money paid to your account and you can do with it what you like:-)

Thanks,Q310_R52_C2,Bad,Xena; now that's what I wanted clarification on. I know I can't take a car loan as it would be secured against the car; which is difficult when I have to go out of country for it. Sooooooo; it is possible to take a personal loan and get the car. Might have to investigate this a bit further :) Saeedkan; you'll have to show me this trick of eating the wrong way. I thought there was only one way :)

Thanks,Q310_R52_C4,PotentiallyUseful,at one stage I wanted to by a second hand car and the bank suggested that due to the interest rate being so high for second hand; about 12%; why not take a personal loan at 8/9% and pay for the car that way:-) So yes; it can be done.

Thanks,Q310_R52_C5,PotentiallyUseful,Rye To be honest; I would do something similar; but my parents live in Dubai; so I'll just book it in for a service over there and go visit for the weekend. Drive down will be fun too. Xena; thanks for the info; all good to know.

Thanks,Q310_R52_C6,Bad,Ouch; I don't know what you're idea of fun is (well; yes I do since I peeked at your profile :) but getting the necessary permits and going through two international borders is not MY idea of a fun weekend! Mandi

Thanks,Q310_R52_C8,Good,Hi Alan; you might wanna re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4% as compared to approx 9% for a personal loan. If you check with manager (not sales guy) of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you. I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too. Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead. With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go (just my oponion)
4278,Q310_R52,I'm looking to by a new car; but the local GM dealer is useless and looked at me like I'd asked for a turbocharged donkey when I said I wanted a manual gearbox. So; I've seen the car I want in Dubai. Is it possible for me to get a loan here; buy the car from Dubai; import and then register it here; or will the bank not allow it as the car isn't in country? Thanks,Q310_R52_C9,Bad,Mandilulur; ignore the profile; its nonsense. I refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum. My name isn't Alan either; but it'll do for this forum :) B2D; driving is always fun; I love cars; always have. Plus its an adventure; never done it before :) Cy; I know about the rates; but the actual monthly payment costs aren't too different; yes I pay more overall; but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want. I'm a Brit; I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear. I bought the car; I'll decide when to change. Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show; and they still aren't as good as a manual box. The wannabe Schumacher's of this world can have them; I'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks. Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox; not a sodding computer. :)

Thanks,Q310_R52_C10,Bad,its was rather weird when I saw your exact name on one of my twitter followings.... apparently you are Katy Perry's favourite comedian;-P I have to agree with you on manuals... yes; I am a chick; but I do know a bit (very small amount) about cars... I also drive a manual and when I went to buy it and insisted on it; the salesman was surprised that I would ask for manual over auto... Besides what you have said regarding manuals... they are also easier to push start should the need arise;-P

In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them;they can be independent in time as they grow old. Try to search for the movie I am Sam;its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future. This is a touching and heart pounding story how a mental challenged father strive to have her little girl. Hope you like this film.

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha.

4382,Q311_R60,Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks,Q311_R60_C3,Bad,Thank you very much for information can anyone have idea how much tiution fees compare to Bright Future Pakistani school in PEC? (Private) school or Govt! Thanks
4383,Q311_R60,Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks,Q311_R60_C4,Good,Frankly speaking; all pakistani schools suck . as none of them have any standard if we compare them to the Indian schools. However; out of the available one; Bright future is the best. DO not go for a lower fee paksitnai school as PEC would be the lowest. If you can afford; get your children in private school like Cambridge etc or otherwise Bright Future is the best.
4384,Q311_R60,Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks,Q311_R60_C5,Good,There are three Pakistani schools here in Qatar.. PEC; Pakshama and Bright Future and to be honest; they all suck big time. I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it wasn't so bad that time. We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good. But then somewhere end of the 80's or beginning of 90's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months. I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly. They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation. In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened. I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two. I would advise you to send your children to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the Indian schools.. There are five of them here and all are equally good.. MES Ideal Indian School Shantinekatan DMIS DPS By the .....
4385,Q311_R60,Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks,Q311_R60_C6,PotentiallyUseful,My eldest son is at Bright Future Pakistani. Honestly; I am not satisfied with the school. They dont have good standard. My son is having problem with his study there. Lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teaching also. They dont have activities to boost the interest of learning for the kids. lack of creativity. Too much URDU Lesson (which I dont understand how to help him with his Urdu homework). If you lucky; your child will be teached by skilled teacher (my son had a very nice and good teacher when he was at KG2 at the same school). Unfortunately this year for grade 1; he's stuck with unskilled teacher :( Indian school? yes they are good; but very difficult to get space. We've been trying for a year now. NO LUCK !! Other international Schools? They suck our blood out ! One thing good is that we can afford the fee of BFS. (My husband is a Pakistani but I am not)
4386,Q311_R60,Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks,Q311_R60_C7,PotentiallyUseful,Hello; Mr.Haroon Abbasi; I donot have an idea about all classes fees of PEC; but one of my neighbor's son who is in 2nd year pays QR.635 (tution QR.485 and transpotQR.150. and one an other boy who is in BFPS and is in grade 8;he pays QR 900.

4391,Q311_R61,Dear QL Members; Which is the best Indian managed C.B.S.E school in Doha;Qatar in terms of Quality of coaching ? ===============================================,Q311_R61_C2,Good,i have repleid to this several times.. MES and IDEAL are having middle class looks; but having good academic records. But the new schools having posh looks; swiming pool; horse riding; big fees ........ all are attraction for new snob couple. the young professional; who come newly to Doha; are having fatty salaries;;;; or education allowance given by the Employers. so u should take ur own decision

4393,Q311_R61,Dear QL Members; Which is the best Indian managed C.B.S.E school in Doha;Qatar in terms of Quality of coaching ? ===============================================,Q311_R61_C4,PotentiallyUseful,Somehow I am not sure what makes a good school. As a parent you have to decide whether you want a school which gives emphasis to extra-curricular activities or academics or a nice mix of two and than go ahead with your questionnaire. As far as the quality of teaching is concerned; teachers are the same as India as they have a work experience from India.
4394,Q311_R61,Dear QL Members; Which is the best Indian managed C.B.S.E school in Doha;Qatar in terms of Quality of coaching ? ===============================================,Q311_R61_C5,Good,MES INDIAN SCHOOL is the best
4395,Q311_R61,Dear QL Members; Which is the best Indian managed C.B.S.E school in Doha;Qatar in terms of Quality of coaching ? ===============================================,Q311_R61_C6,Good,It depends on your nationality and salary to choose the best school. if u r an indian whose salary is average then u can choose one among IDEAL or MES.(if u r a mallu u wud choose MES).if ur salary is high then u can choose BIRLA DMIS or MIS.
4396,Q311_R61,Dear QL Members; Which is the best Indian managed C.B.S.E school in Doha;Qatar in terms of Quality of coaching ? ===============================================,Q311_R61_C7,Good,Hi. This depends your point of view about education. MES and Ideal Indian schools are quite old ones and they are reasonably good in the academic side. If you send me a private message I will be able to give you more details about MES. There are number of new Indian schools coming up these days with more facilties for students but less number of students.Their ratio of students teacher is 25-30:1.I think you may choose one of them. DPS;MIS;BPS and so forth. Good luck

4398,Q311_R61,Dear QL Members; Which is the best Indian managed C.B.S.E school in Doha;Qatar in terms of Quality of coaching ? ===============================================,Q311_R61_C9,Good,My child is studying at Birla and am quite happy with their coaching. Ofcourse; not much attention towards extra curricular activites and sports. But my daughter is happy with her teachers who seem to be professionals. Almost all schools like BPS; Dps and DMIS are on the same footing. Excepting that DMIS are charing exorbitant rates for their 7-4 timings at school.
4399,Q311_R61,Dear QL Members; Which is the best Indian managed C.B.S.E school in Doha;Qatar in terms of Quality of coaching ? ===============================================,Q311_R61_C10,Good,the best indian cbse school is the BHAVAN'S PUBLIC SCHOOL AT WAKRA and MATAR QADEEM.Needeless to say that even though started recently it has successfully produced a set of responsible;kind and intelligent citizens aware of their roles in this modern worlds.If u go to their website www.bhavansqatar.org apart from their esteemed panel and directors it is run by a philanthropist as a temple for education and all round development and hence unlike .com it is a .org an organisation.Iam happy being a part n u too should be one very now.

Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??,Q313_R4_C4,PotentiallyUseful,There is not much relation between the Rent and the Quality of the Premises. Here Pricing is based purely on economis..based on Demand and Supply.. Its your responsibility to find an appartment which justifies its rent . All d best man
4504,Q313_R4,It’s famous that accommodation is expensive in Qatar; but is that reflecting good standards of finishing; decorations; facilities etc.??? Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??,Q313_R4_C5,Good,In general the higher the price the newer and better the house/apartment. However note that some new houses have high rents ('cause they're new and big) but are located in crap areas! For a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15'000 QR; and many of those places already have waiting lists. Prices however are not comparable to rentals in other countries. There's shortage of good accommodations which increases the rates; it's not that housing is better in Doha then elsewhere. If your employer won't take care of it; best is to come here and take a look by yourself... Good luck.

Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??,Q313_R4_C6,Bad,Luciano From my experience the cheaper places (7-8k a month) have lower quality than the more expensive places (18k for a 2 bedroom). However; do not expect to see excellent quality on the expensive places either because you won't.

Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??,Q313_R4_C8,Good,Accommodations of higher rent like 15k to 25k per month will be in better quality than the cheaper ones. It is not necessary that the facilities will be very good if you are paying a bigger rent. I think now a days the rents are depending on the locations and not on the facilities. There are some areas in Qatar where you have to pay 7-8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there are some areas where you will be asked for 10-12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facilities.

4510,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C1,Good,The cost of living here is cheap! Although when we talk about rentals for apartments/villas/flats it is expensive. Grocery items are priced reasonably and is affordable and worth. Eating at restaurants more than once a week is fine (restaurants that are not fine dine). Clothing. There are many store here to choose your clothes from. There are many stores inside the shopping mall that is more often than not that sell on sale. Cosmetics. Well I'm a boy and so I don't know much about these but I see most women here wear make up always so I think the price is tolerable. Obviously the prices of oil and gas here is cheap. So overall; living here in Doha is cheap.
4511,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C2,Good,doha is very cheap..for rich people.
4512,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C3,Good,its depends on ur earning & ur life style but i think its expensive:)
4513,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C4,Good,30% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN 4 YEARS AGO. DON'T BE FOOLED....£5 FOR A DOZEN EGGS. MAKEUP DOUBLE THAN IN UK. WESTERN BUTTER £3 SMALL. CLOTHES FROM WESTERN SHOPS 20% MORE...JUST READ THE LABELS. I BUY IN UK AND BRING IT OVER ONLY THING GOOD IS THE PETROL; £6 TO FILL MY COROLLA.
4514,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C5,Good,Doha is the most expensive city in the GCC (atleast more expensive than Dubai these days). House rents; car rentals; groceries; and everything else; except for petrol is higher. Please don't ask me for a source. This is my personal opinion.
4515,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C6,Good,COMPARE TO OTHER MIDDLE EAST SPECIALLY DUBAI AND KUWAIT DOHA IS LESS EXPENSIVE.RENT IS AFFORDABLE ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE'S STANDARD.
4516,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C7,Good,"""I agree 100% with Ralph; the 1st post. Housing is very expensive; although it's coming down very fast. I just signed a lease on a villa for 10500QR/mth(~$2900USD). It's brand new; 2 stories; 4 beds; 3 1/2 baths; huge rear patio; covered parking; pool; clubhouse; close to Villagio Mall. You can get furnished 2-3 bed apts for 6500-9000Qr/mth (~$1800+) all over the place nowadays. Groceries are cheap for the most part. Only certain ; select items are really expensive. Petrol is practically free here. Utilities (if you have to pay them at all) are very cheap. The best place to buy clothing is on the internet or wait for a sale in the mall stores. Other household items and appliances are very reasonably priced as well. As someone mentioned; it really depends on your income and usual standard of living. The 'general labor' ex-pats will find it extremely expensive. For you and anyone looking for the best car rental rates from a professional rental company; I would suggest using """"Strong Rent-A....."""
4517,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C8,Good,mr. qatar-engineer seems more like the salesman at Strong rent a car. Anyway; Qatar is one of the most expensive countries to live in. Agreed; this is not the case if your housing; schooling; etc are paid. But groceries are obv much more expensive than every country I have been to (except Japan). Since qatar does not have income tax; assume you are taxed about 30% of your salary when you go to buy food; cars; groceries etc.
4518,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C9,Bad,I'm just trying to save ex-pats from the pitfalls I faced when I landed here awhile back. It wasn't until I found Strong that I realized I was being screwed on car rentals. Groceries are not as expensive as Kuwait or Bahrain (both countries I have lived in recently). Perhaps you just haven't lived in too many other places to judge prices properly....? just a thought...
4519,Q313_R6,I haven't moved there yet and was wondering how it compares to most European cities... eating out; supermarket shopping; clothes; cosmetics; etc.,Q313_R6_C10,Good,I have lived in Europe briefly; and of course my native Australia. I lived in Abu Dhabi 2 years prior to coming here. In comparison to Abu Dhabi - much the same for groceries; cheaper for accomodation. As a general rule; petrol and cigarettes; and consumer durable products are much cheaper here than Australia & Europe. Groceries are much more expensive; as they are imported. However; and ironically; I have been paying less for Australian lamb & beef here; than when I left Australia. Mick

4570,Q313_R43,I will be living in Qatar for a couple of years and I am concerned if we got sick we might not be able to afford the treatment without some sort of Health Insurance,Q313_R43_C1,Good,you can have a public health insurance in doha for 200QR.... if you are looking for higher health coverage; you will be talking about 1500-3000QR a year (private hospitals) anyways; health services are available for quite affordable prices in doha; I have been living here for 3 years now; thank god; I have not needed any serious medication; but as I hear from the guys it is not that expensive (considering that doha is TAX FREE country) if you are looking for teeth insurance... (in can range from 150-250 riyals per tooth for normal teeth rust fixing); but if it is a surgery... then it is 500 riyals and above per tooth.  dont worry about it.... it is steaming hot here and you will like it :P

4572,Q313_R43,I will be living in Qatar for a couple of years and I am concerned if we got sick we might not be able to afford the treatment without some sort of Health Insurance,Q313_R43_C3,Good,I am from England and i think we have a similar National Health system there than Australia so I think I know where you are coming from.  I was also a nurse back home so I have formed my opinions of the health service here based on this.  Qatar has a NHS that is available to all residents once you have paid 100QR for a health card that gives you a patient number. This entitles you to emergency treatment; routine referrals; surgery etc. It is not free at the point of delivery but an outpatient appointment is 50QR for the first appointment then 30QR each visit. Overnight stays depend on the type of ward you choose; single room; semi private (2 beds) or ward (4 beds).  I had an op here and was in a 4 bed ward and it was fine; cost 100QR for 2 nights.  The health service is based on the American model and is regulated by a Canadian company as far as I know so all issues with culture; confidentiality; patient rights are similar to the experience I had in the UK.  Thee are 2 private hos.....

Kids did ok; but were not at all challenged. Biggest issue is the student mix and the site. It's too small now (around 200 kids I understand); so they have lunch in the classroom and take turns at playing outside. Quality of ed. is basic. Owing to language difficulties; (loads of Dutch and Danes) it's lowest common denominator stuff. But if your kids are bright; even the schools that are 'closed' will interview and test. Ours are now going to one that has been full for 4 years; but we didn't have to wait as they did v well on the entrance exam. Hamdulillah. And the fees? As said above; """"because they can""""..."""

Thanks in advance!,Q314_R28_C7,Good,without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.

You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family. No logic in them providing insurance just for you. Second; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car; a good vehicle; say a honda civic would cost you qrs. 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more. Third; do check where your working base is going to be. Is it in Al Khor? If yes; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home. I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side. All the best. Cheerios

Recently a colleague who's worked in Qatar told me that single guys aren't allowed in to malls & other places on weekends.(unless they're accompanied by women or a family) Is this true? If true; do these restrictions extend to coffee shops; supermarkets; movies & other places. Also if true; why on earth is there such a rule?,Q315_R43_C8,Good,Nothing like that. If you are a decent person; can go everywhere but there are only restrictions in two malls on Friday for the labourers to give more opportunities to the families. As they declare it as family day. But not everywhere in Qatar.

I moved in August as well. but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on. Quick addition: I do suggest you actually move with stuff... especially if you and your partner are doing this together. clothing is expensive here and if it's just 'your own stuff' that you want around the house; pack a few boxes of clothes you want; pics; music or books or whatever. everything retail and consumable is expensive. As for a moving company.... I've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place. Visa stuff... let the employer take are of that. I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents (birth certs; marriage certs; etc.)... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them. Plus; if you can even get one of each certified by the Qatar consulate in Canada before you go (yo.....

I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.

Their containers are all new. Their service staffs were polite. They have a timely deliveries so you wont worry wether you're out or still have spare containers left not consumed. They will only replenish your empty containers. No more to hurry for calling them at time you have water shortages. Besides; they are offering one(1) free standing Water Cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buying 2 booklet water coupons. At a cost of QAR1100.00 for 200pcs 5-gallon bottles; it's worth more than a service and the pure healthy water. I just had availed of it two weeks ago; i have a new cooler dispenser now. Call them at TEl: 4509555 Fax: 4509444 or email them at: info@aljazeerawater.com for more queries; simply call ANWAR HUSSAIN with mobile: 6191064 for additional info.

4940,Q317_R10,Hi all! Me and some friends from london are looking to come over to Doha for a couple of weeks. Whats the party scene like on Friday and Saturday nights? I hear that in Qatar nobody goes out on saturday; is that true? Where would you go for RnB and hiphop? And Ive heard alot about a club called Qube is it any good? Any feedback would be welcome thanks!,Q317_R10_C1,Good,If you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the Qube is GREAT; however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to Garvey's; Rugby Club; and Rydges. Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to.

Thank you.,Q317_R16_C9,Good,"""Hi; I strongly recommend Evian. It's a bit more expensive than other water but it's worth it and you find it in all Carrefours. You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunately...if you decide to go for another brand; make sure Sodium content is less than 20. We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my 6 months old is on Evian. My 5 year old was also on it when she was little. Also; what formula are you using? they are not always identical to UK ones. I tried Nestle's NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now. I don't know if it's your first baby but in case it is - don't worry to much about what is so called """"recommended milk intake is"""" - both my daughters always took at least 30% less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal. Feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice."""
